3. What is phenomenology?

- Using brain imaging techniques, for example employing an fMRI scanner, to assess which parts of the brain are responsible for conscious experiences. 
- The subjective “feel” of something such as the taste of chocolate or mint.
- The claim that our phenomenal, introspective states cannot be explained scientifically.
- [x] Using introspection to reflect on our conscious life, from a subjective point of view.

4. Which of the following would be examples of reductive explanations? (Pick 3)

- [x] Explaining how a person’s conscious feelings arise by appealing to their brain mechanisms.
- Explaining why we fall asleep by appealing to the tiring activities of the preceding day.
- Explaining why a window is broken by appealing to a brick which has been thrown though it.
- Explaining why a washing machine broke by appealing to the incompetence of the technician who maintains it.
- [x] Explaining the properties of water by appealing to its underlying chemical structure.
- [x] Explaining the pressure and temperature of gasses by appealing to laws and mechanisms concerning the constituent molecules of the gas.

5. What is Frank Jackson’s thought experiment involving the character Mary supposed to show?

- Learning everything there is to know about neuroscience is not sufficient to understand the poetic connotations associated with the rose.
- The unhealthy psychological effects of prolonged solitary confinement.
- Learning everything there is to know about neuroscience is sufficient to know what it is like, subjectively, to experience colour.
- [x] Learning everything there is to know about neuroscience would not be sufficient to know what it is like, subjectively, to experience colour.

6. Which of the following questions have scientists researching consciousness recently been interested in? (Pick two)

- What neural activity is responsible for our moral decision making, i.e. our conscience?
- [x] What neural activity determines the content of consciousness, i.e. what we experience?
- What neural activity is responsible for the fact that we experience anything at all?
- [x] What neural activity determines the particular state of consciousness that we are in, i.e. awake, asleep, or in a coma?

7. What is the difference between wakefulness and awareness?

- Wakefulness determines whether there is any activity going on in our brain, and awareness determines whether or not we are aware of that activity.
- There is no difference – both terms refer to whether or not we are conscious.
- [x] Wakefulness determines whether we are awake or asleep, whilst awareness determines whether we experience anything or not.

8. What are the three hallmarks of a bistable image? (Pick 3)

- [x] Two or more possible conscious interpretations.
- Different people see a different interpretation of the same image.
- [x] The interpretation that dominates awareness tends to switch every few seconds.
- An image can be interpreted in two or more different ways, but only one interpretation can ever be seen.
- [x] Only one interpretation is consciously perceived at any one time.
- Two interpretations of a single image are consciously perceived at once.

9. What are bistable images used for in consciousness science?

- They are not used, as it might be distressing to experience a bistable image that our minds cannot fully comprehend.
- They are used in order to place subjects into a trance-like state.
- Investigating a case where our perceptual experience stays the same even though our environment is changing.
- [x] Investigating a case where our perceptual experience changes even though the stimulus evoking it does not.

10. What is backward visual masking used for in consciousness science?

- Investigating whether consciousness can be used exert an influence on events that have already occurred.
- [x] Investigating whether images that we are not consciously aware of can influence our behaviour. 
- Investigating whether images that we are consciously aware of can be suppressed by later experiences.
