# Week 4 Quiz: Embodied cognition and the sciences of the mind

1. How does the desert ant find its way home?

- By asking a local for directions. 
- [x] By aiming towards environmental features that it recognises, rather than by using a mental map of any kind.
- By building a mental map that it can use to navigate with, without any need to observe its environment. 
- By looking for environmental features that it recognises, and then cross-referencing these with a mental map.

2. Why is it unsurprising that the brain makes use of the body to scaffold cognition?

- [x] Because it makes evolutionary sense for the brain to take advantage of any stable features of its environment, such as the body.
- Because without a body the brain would be unable to survive. 
- This is a trick question: the brain does not make use of the body to scaffold cognitive processes. 
- Because Aristotle predicted this thousands of years ago.

3. How do we explain the impressive swimming capacities of the Bluefin tuna?

- It is extremely muscular and very talented at swimming. 
- [x] It is able to exploit features of its environment, such as currents and vortices, including those that it has created itself.
- It latches on to larger, faster fish and hitches a ride. 
- It is equipped with an outboard motor. 

4. How do ants build their nests?

- [x] By instinctively depositing small pebbles a certain distance from their larvae, and then continuing to deposit pebbles next to those previously deposited, naturally forming a wall.
- They do not build nests, but instead occupy the abandoned nests of other species of insect. 
- They mindlessly follow the instructions of the queen ant, which is the only one who knows what they are doing. 
- By carefully planning the structure of the walls before building the nest out of small pebbles. 

5. How does Babybot learn about the world?

- It crawls around until it finds something, and then spends a long period of time (hours or even days) studying what it has found. 
- It comes pre-equipped with a complete set of facts about the world. 
- [x] It moves its limbs around and catalogues the patterns of interactions that it experiences.
- It asks its Motherbot a series of increasingly complicated questions. 

6. What is a “rich, time-locked pattern of multimodal stimulation”.

- An integration of input concerning multiple objects over an extended period of time, allowing for the formation of a representation capturing a whole scene. 
- An integration of input from a single sense over an extended period of time, allowing for the formation of a complex model of an object. 
- [x] An integration of simultaneous input from multiple senses, allowing for the formation of a complex, multisensory model of an object.

7. What is difficult about identifying a chair?

- [x] There is no stable set of features that can provide necessary and sufficient conditions for being a chair.
- They typically consist of only straight lines, which are hard for visual systems to perceive. 
- They often blend in with their backgrounds, as directed by the principles of interior design. 
- Whilst there is a stable set of features that provide necessary and sufficient conditions for being a chair, it exists only in the platonic realm of forms, which we cannot access. 

8. What might a robot need to be able to do in order to identify a chair? 

- Possess a complex enough language to ask someone what a chair is.  
- Grasp the necessary and sufficient conditions for being a chair. 
- Integrate input from multiple sensory modalities. 
- [x] Be able to use a chair, and thus identify chairs as those objects that it can use as chairs.

9. What is a multilayer control system?

- It is a control system that devotes most of its processing power to immediate processes, such as avoiding oncoming traffic, whilst delaying long term planning until it has time to rest. 
- [x]  It is a control system that leaves immediate processes, such as avoiding oncoming traffic, to operate on their own, whilst higher level processes focus on longer term planning. 
- It is a control system that consists of many very simple processes that combine into a greater whole. 

10. What is the naked brain fallacy?

- An approach to cognitive science that denies the existence of the external world. 
- An approach to cognitive science that denies the existence of the brain. 
- [x] An approach to cognitive science that treats the brain as an isolated, rather than embodied, system.
- An approach to cognitive science that treats the brain as an embodied, rather than isolated, system.
