# Week 2 Quiz

1. **What’s the difference between circumstantial evidence and causal evidence?**

Circumstantial evidence can’t rule out coincidence, or mere correlation, and causal evidence can. 

2. **What is the main reason why researchers randomize clinical trials for drugs or medical treatments?**

To remove potential biases inherent in any human activity.  

3. **Randomized trials and peer-review are an expression of the scientific community’s broader commitment to what?**

Scientific empiricism, which is the idea that scientific knowledge should come from unbiased observations of the world. 

4. **Why is observation thought to be the bedrock of science?**

- Observations are public. If some phenomenon really exists, other people  should be able to see the same things you see, eliminating the  possibility of bias.
- The aim of science is to learn about the world, so science necessitates the observation of the world.  

5. **How do scientists enhance their ability to observe the natural world?**

- Through technology, such as telescopes 
- Through practice, or repeated observation of the same or similar phenomena 

6. **How do scientists make observations of rare phenomenon more efficient?**

- Coordination between large groups of scientists 
- Automation
- Crowdsourcing

7. **Why are experiments so important to scientific study?**

- Scientists can use experiments to create a new phenomenon of interest. 
- Scientists can use experiments to isolate and study an existing phenomenon from the rest of the world.   

8. **Why doesn’t a strong correlation between two phenomena equal proof of a causal relationship between those two phenomena?**

- Because the two phenomena could always have an unknown common cause. 

9. **At its core, a computer simulation consists of what?**

- A model and initial conditions

10. **How are simulations and experiments similar?**

- In both cases, scientists can create conditions to test what happens when one or just a few variables are manipulated.
- Assumptions made in both experiments and simulations are based on prior observations about the world. 

11. **In the context of science, I argue observation should be understood as what?**

Reliable detection
