# Week 1 Quiz: Do our modern skulls house stone-age minds?

1. **In the  mural on the wall of a library in the Pope's Palace in the Vatican,  Aristotle is depicted holding his hand down to the earth. Plato is  pictured holding his hand upwards to the sky. What do these hand  gestures symbolize?**

Both philosophers’ views on the source of true knowledge. 

2. **In 2017, scientists observed the merging of two neutron stars for the first time. What theory did this observation support?**

The observation supported Albert Einstein’s theory of general relativity.  

3. **Why did governments around the world ban CFC-11?**

Because scientists discovered it puts holes in the ozone layer, which  can lead to more UV radiation, and thus, more cancer among humans, among  other negative effects. 

4. **What is/are the primary goal(s) of philosophers of science?**

To ask questions about what science is, how it works, and what role it should play in our society. 

5. **Tortoises living on islands in the Galapagos  archipelago with lush vegetation have dome shaped shells, but tortoises  living on nearby islands with sparse vegetation have saddleback shells  that allow them to reach higher up. What would biologists say this is an  example of?**

Adaptation, or good “fit” between a species and its environment. 

6. **Which  scientist is well-known for outlining the mechanism by which populations of organisms adapt to their environments? What was that  mechanism and how does it work?**

Charles Darwin; natural selection, which states that minute changes in  individual organisms culminates over many generations into significant morphological changes.

7. **Peter and Rosemary Grant studied the Medium Ground Finch on Daphne Major Island in the Galapagos for 40 years. What did they find and how did their project’s results support Darwin’s theory of natural selection?**

They found that finches with larger beaks did better in periods of extreme drought, when hard, woody seeds were the only available food. These individuals then passed their larger beak trait on to their  offspring. This supports the idea that changes in the environment lead  to changes in the populations of organisms living in that environment.  

8. **Why did redshifts tell Hubble the universe was expanding?**

When a galaxy at the edge of our universe speeds away from our galaxy,  its light waves are stretched from higher frequencies light waves, like  blue, to lower frequencies light waves, like red. If the universe was  static, Hubble wouldn’t have observed these shifts. 

9. **What does the theory of the greenhouse effect state?**

The theory says that gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, trap  the sun's heat in the Earth's atmosphere, much like a greenhouse. 

10. **How  do scientists know global warming is primarily the result of human  activity and not changes in natural phenomena, such as volcano eruptions  or an increase in the sun’s emission of heat?**

Because even when scientists factor in natural causes of global  warming, they’ve found that these phenomena can’t account for record  warming we’ve seen.

11. **What’s the primary reason why psychologists still debate the nature of young children’s understanding (or lack thereof) of false beliefs?**

Because some studies suggest young children can’t attribute false beliefs to others, while others suggest young children have a general inability comprehend false beliefs. 

12. **Some philosophers of science argue that when you take a close look at  scientific practice, you don’t find much unity at all. Why do I  disagree?**

I (the instructor) argues:

* all of science is united by careful and sophisticated methods of observation. 
* all of scientific theories are united by their refinement over generations of scientists 
* all of science is united by the use of multiple,  independent lines of evidence converging one a central explanation of  natural phenomena.
