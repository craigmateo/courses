# Assignment: Analysis of Science Reporting

*Find a news article about a specific scientific study and trace it back to the scientific paper it’s reporting on. Summarize the research in your own words. Compare the difference between how the study is communicated by the journalist and how the study is communicated in the scientific paper. What do you think the journalist correctly communicated about the study? What did the journalist incorrectly communicate or oversimplify? Bring in topics we've learned about in class (e.g. objectivity, values, methods) in your discussion of the study and the news article. Word limit: 500*

### News Article:

#### Analysis

The research addresses "unclear" and "debated" effects of digital media on the cognitive development of children. The authors' hypothesis is that genetic data could clarify causal claims, since the role of genetic predispositions has typically not been considered in correlations between digital media and children's intelligence. 

In their methodology, the authors use statistical correlation to estimate the impact of different types of screen time (defined as "watching, socializing, or gaming") on children's intelligence while controlling for genetic differences in cognition and socioeconomic status. The study analyzed 9855 children (ages 9–10) from the USA with a baseline measure of intelligence and followed-up after two years. Consistent with experimental studies on video gaming, the authors found gaming positively impacted intelligence (standardized β =  + 0.17). However, in contrast with prior research, they found watching videos also benefited intelligence.

The news article effectively summarizes the original paper. It uses direct quotations and includes a link to the journal. Importantly, it also mentions the limitations of the study. The journalist correctly communicates the methodology and focus on confounding factors such as genetics. However, the news article perhaps understates the limitations of the study and suggests there are "causal links", which is not the same as statistical correlation. 

In both the original paper and news article, I found the notion of intelligence was oversimplified and even problematic. Given the long history of pseudoscientific measures of 'intelligence' being used to justify social and cultural biases and discrimination, this topic needs careful consideration. Discussions from other fields (e.g., cognitive sciences) related to the difficulty of defining and quantifying intelligence are also lacking in this study. 

This study is an example of how the aim for objectivity (through quantitative and statistical methods) may crowd out conceptual clarity and critical thinking. Quantifiable does not necessarily mean scientific as datasets often inherit biases. Moreover, the use of scientific methods does not preclude other forms of critical inquiry. That said, the topic (impact of digital media on cognitive development) is very relevant and objective, evidence based research maybe be crucial for social and cognitive development of children.
