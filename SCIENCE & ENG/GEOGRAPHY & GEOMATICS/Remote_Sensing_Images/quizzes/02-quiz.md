## Week 2 Quiz

1. **To detect healthy vegetation the best wavelength range to use is (choose one)**

near infrared.  

Green vegetation is strongly reflecting in the near infrared, and changes in condition also show up well.

2. **To detect the difference between healthy green vegetation and the same vegetation that has lost its pigmentation due to senescence is to image in the (choose one answer)**

visible red

The loss of chlorophyll that accompanies plant drying is best seen in the visible red, where chlorophyll absorption no longer occurs.

3. **To detect moisture stress in vegetation, and the drying of soils, imaging at which of the following wavelengths would be preferable?**

1.45Î¼m 

It is in one of the water absorption bands.

4. **Mismatched detector characteristics in a push broom scanner will lead to**

line striping along the swath

5. **With regard to possible radiometric distortion over the range of visible and reflected infrared wavelengths, the solar radiation curve, described by Planck's law**

must be compensated for

Otherwise the relative pixel values from band to band will not be the same as the reflectance of the earth surface cover types; they will be biased by the shape of the solar curve.

6. **The wavelength dependence of atmospheric scattering is strongest when**

when there is light haze with scattered clouds

7. **In the range of wavelengths commonly used in remote sensing the most significant absorbing constituent in the atmosphere is**

water vapour

8. **Panoramic (geometric) distortion is caused by**

the difference in projected area on the ground across the swath at constant IFOV

At a constant angular IFOV the "pixel size" on the ground is larger at the swath edges than at nadir.

9. **At its simplest level, correcting errors in image geometry using matrix mathematical models requires**

the distortions to be a linear function of the imaging coordinates

Because the matrix elements are the coefficient in a linear transformation.

10. **Geometric distortion caused by earth rotation will be present for most imaging sensors in spacecraft remote sensing.**

true

Because the earth rotates at a finite rate and the spacecraft acquires an image over a finite time duration earth rotational distortion will always occur.
