# Unit 7: Thermochemistry

1. A Bunsen burner is lit and used to heat a water bath. This is a conversion of ___________ in the bonds of methane gas and oxygen to ______________ as the temperature of the water increases and the molecules of water increase their speed.


2. At 25.0 °C and 1.50 atm, 3.00 L if a gas is compressed to 0.150 L of gas. Calculate the amount of work performed on the gas as it is compressed.


3. Consider the process in Question 1: A Bunsen burner is lit and used to heat a water bath. The reaction of which enables the Bunsen burner to operate is ___________. The sign of ΔH is _______. 


4. Determine the amount of heat (in kJ) released as 21.5 g of NO reacts with an excess of O2 according to the reaction:2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ΔH = –114.6 kJ


5. Determine the change in internal energy, ΔE (in kJ), for the following reaction (as balanced) under constant pressure conditions at 25.0 °C.2NO(g) + O2(g) → 2NO2(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ΔH = –114.6 kJ


6. Use the experimental information below to calculate ΔH for the following reaction:MgO(s) + 2H+(aq) → Mg2+(aq) + H2O(l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ΔH= ?In the coffee cups, 0.300 g MgO is dissolved into 150.0 g of 0.100 M HCl.  The temperature of the solution rises from 23.64 °C to 25.37 °C. The heat capacity of the calorimeter is negligible. The specific heat of the HCl solution is 4.18 J/g °C.


7. Using the information in the table provided below, calculate the heat of combustion of methanol, as balanced:2CH3OH(g) + 3O2(g) → 2CO2(g) + 4H2O(g)     ΔH° = ?SubstanceCH3OH(g)CO2(g)H2O(l)H2O(g)ΔHf°, kJ/mol–238.7–393.5–285.8–241.8
