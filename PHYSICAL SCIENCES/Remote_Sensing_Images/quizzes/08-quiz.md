1. The multi-layer Perceptron has to have at least two hidden layers. Choose the correct answer

- [ ] True
- [x] False

2. The main difference between a threshold logic unit (TLU) and a processing element (PE) is (choose one):

- [ ] Their outputs reach different values in the limit
- [ ] The TLU has fewer inputs than the PE
- [x] The PE includes a differentiable activation function whereas the TLU does not

That is correct.  The differentiable activation function makes it possible to develop a training process for the neural network

3. The depth of e neural network us defined by (choose one):

- [x] The number of hidden layers
- [ ] The total number of layers
- [ ] The number of hidden layers plus 1


4. A fully connected neural network (choose one):

- [ ] Ensures that there is at least one pathway from the input nodes to the output nodes
- [ ] Must have at least one hidden layer
- [x] All outputs from the node in one layer are connected to all nodes of the subsequent layer

That is correct because all possible connections are used.

5. A neural network has been trained to classify an image into 16 classes.&nbsp; The number of nodes in the output layer can be

- [ ] 5
- [ ] 7
- [x] 4

That is correct: 16 classes can be represented by 4 nodes if those nodes are a binary code (from 0 to 15, i.e. 16 cases)

6. The use of a momentum term during neural network training is designed to (choose one):

- [x] improve convergence and speed up training
- [ ] Allow some of the less important linkages between layers to be removed
- [ ] Set a limit on the number of iterations to be used.

That is correct.

7. The neural network is (choose one):

- [ ] a binary classifier
- [x] A multi-class classifier
- [ ] A multi-class decision tree

That is correct.

8. Design of a neural network for remote sensing applications requires the user to

- [ ] Specify the number of nodes to use in a single hidden layer
- [ ] Specify the number of hidden layers to use and the number of nodes in all layers
- [x] Specify the number of hidden layers to use, the number of nodes in all layers and the nature of the activation function

That is correct.  These parameters fully specify the design

9. In its fundamental operation (based on its underlying equations) the neural network is most like (choose one):

- [ ] The maximum likelihood classifier
- [ ] The support vector machine
- [x] The minimum distance classifier

10.  Which of the following statements is true?

- [x] Iteration over a labelled training set of pixels is required for both the neural network and the support vector classifier
- [ ] Both the maximum likelihood classifier and the neural network make use of class covariance matrix information
- [ ] Both the maximum likelihood classifier and the neural network are multi-class techniques.

That is not correct for the SVM
