## Week 1 Quiz

1. **Scattered sunlight is the most common source of energy used to create images of the earthâ€™s surface in remote sensing. True or false?**

false

2. **The earth's atmospheric layer:**

both absorbs and scatters sunlight

3. **The visible and reflected infra red wavelength ranges together are called:**

the optical wavelengths

4. **An atmospheric window is a region of the electromagnetic spectrum in which:**

sufficient reflected sunlight, or energy emitted by the earth itself, reaches the sensor such that images can be formed

5. **Satellites are the preferred remote sensing platforms when**

we want cost-effective imaging over large areas

6. **Remote sensing satellites take about 90 minutes to orbit the earth and yet cover the whole earth in about one or two weeks.  That is possible because**

the earth is rotating under the satellite

7. **A scan across an image swath recorded by a line scanner takes a finite time, during which the platform is moving.  This will show up in the image as**

a distortion in the geometry in the along-track direction

8. **In a push broom scanner the images recorded at different wavelengths**

in principle, exactly match each other geometrically

9. **In a hyperspectral sensor the images at each of the hundreds of different wavelengths are**

recorded simultaneously

10. **An image is completely described technically by**

IFOV, FOV, frame size, radiometric resolution and number of bands
