F is incorrect. Remember, when you place your finger on the first fret, you're moving up in half step; so for the A string, if you place your finger on the first fret the note becomes A#, and moves up in half step with each fret. Knowing this, what note would playing the A string on the tenth fret produce? Refer to the video "Notes on the Fretboard" to review this information.
