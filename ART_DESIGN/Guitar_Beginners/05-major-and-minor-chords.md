# Major and Minor Chords

1. To convert a major chord to a minor chord:

- [x] Lower the third a half step
- [ ] Lower the third a whole step
- [ ] Raise the third a half step
- [ ] Raise the third a whole step

Lower the third a half step is correct! In a major triad, the root and the third are a major 3rd apart and the third and the fifth are a minor third apart. In a minor triad, the root and the third are a minor 3rd apart and the third and the fifth are a major 3rd apart. If we lower the third by a half step, the interval between the root and the third would become a minor 3rd, thus creating a minor triad.

2. The notes in an A major triad are A, C#, and E. The notes in an A minor chord are:

- [x] A, C, and E
- [ ] A, C, and E#
- [ ] Ab, C, and E
- [ ] A, Cb, and E

A, C, and E is correct! To convert a major chord to a minor chord, you lower the third by a half step. C# to C is a half step!

- [ ] C, E, and Gb
- [ ] C, E#, and G
- [x] C, Eb, and G

C, Eb, and G is correct! To convert a major chord to a minor chord, you lower the third by a half step. E to Eb is a half step!

4. The notes in a D major triad are:

- [ ] D, Fb, and A
- [ ] D, F, and Ab

D, F#, and A is correct! A major triad is built with a major third on the bottom and a minor third on the top. D to F# is a major third, and F# to A is a minor third.

- [ ] Change the D to Db
- [ ] Change the G to Gb
- [ ] Change the B to C
