Correct! Adding a sharp makes a note one half step higher which means A# is one half step above A. 

2. What note is a half step above E?

Correct! E and F are naturally a half step apart so one half step above E is F. 

3. What note is a half step below B?

Use the note wheel to find the correct answer: begin at A and remember, each segment of the note wheel is a half step. In choosing your direction, go clockwise when you want to go up and counter clockwise when you want to go down. Count up two segments (or half steps) from A and you will arrive at the correct answer.

Correct! E and F are naturally a half step apart so to go up a whole step from E, you need to add a sharp to the F, which is F#. 

8. What note is a whole step above B?

Correct! B and C are naturally a half step apart so to go up a whole step from B, you need to add a sharp to the C, which is C#.

9. What note is a whole step below F?
