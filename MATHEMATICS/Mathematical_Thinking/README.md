# An Introduction to Mathematical Thinking

My solutions to assignments for the Coursera course "An Introduction to Mathematical Thinking" from Stanford University. 
Course Description: https://www.coursera.org/learn/mathematical-thinking

These are my original solutions and not necessarily the same as the solutions provided in the tutorials.

## Getting Started

Each assignment is a LaTeX source file. To view, use a LaTeX distribution and compile the .tex file.

### Prerequisites

If you are new to compiling LaTeX, you can get started by visiting the thread "How to compile a LaTeX document?"
