\begin{enumerate}

\item{Show that \(\neg[\exists x A(x)]\) is equivalent to \(\forall x [\neg A(x)]\).}


\textcolor{blue} {\(\neg[\exists x A(x)]\) means there does not exist an \(x\) such that \(A(x)\) is true. This implies that for all \(x\), \(A(x)]\) is not the case. In symbolic notation, this statement is equivalent to \(\forall x [\neg A(x)]\).}


\item{ Prove that the following statement is false:}

\begin{center}
\textit{There is an even prime bigger than \(2\) .}
\end{center}

\textcolor{blue} {Assume the statement is true, that is \(\exists x[(x\) prime\()(x>2)(x=2n)\) for some \(n\in\mathbb{N}\). \(x=2/n\), which means that \(n>1\) (since \(x>2\)). However, if \(n>1\) then \(x\) cannot be prime since a prime number is divisible by \(1\) and itself and \(x\) is divisible by \(2\).}

\item{Translate the following sentences into symbolic form using quantifiers. In each case the assumed domain is given in parentheses.}
