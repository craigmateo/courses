\item{Prove that the intersection of two intervals is again an interval. Is the same true for unions?}

\textcolor{blue} {Assuming a non-empty intersection. A set \(S\) is an interval if \((\forall a,b \in S)( \forall y \in \mathbb{R})(a \leq y \leq b) \rightarrow y \in S\). Let \(S\) and \(T\) be intervals, where \(a, b \in S\cap T\) and  \(a \leq y \leq b\). \(y \in S\) and \(y \in T\), so \(S\cap T\) is an interval.}\


\textcolor{blue} {The same is not true for unions. Consider \(S=(a,b) \cup (b,c)\). This cannot be an interval since \(b\) cannot be in \(S\).}

\item{Taking \(\mathbb{R}\) as the universal set, express the following as simply as possible in terms of intervals and unions of intervals.}

\item{Prove that if a set \(A\) of integers/rationals/reals has an upper bound, then it has infinitely many different upper bounds.}

\textcolor{blue} {An upper bound of \(A\) is an element \(m\) such that \(\forall n \in A, m \geq n\). Let \(U\) be the set consisting of the upper bounds of \(A\). Assume \(U\) is finite. Then there is a largest element \(u \in U\). But there is a \(v \in \mathbb{R}\) such that \(v>u\), making \(v\) an upper bound not in \(U\). This is a contradiction. Therefore, \(A\) has infinitely many different upper bounds.} 

\item{Prove that if a set \(A\) of integers/rationals/reals has a least upper bound, then it is unique.}

\textcolor{blue} {Assume \(x\) is the lub and assume a non-unique lub.  This means \(\exists y \neq x\) such that \(y\) is a lub. If \(y>x\) then \(y\) is not a lub. If \(y<x\) then \(x\) is not a lub. This is a contradiction. Therefore, the lub is unique.} 

\item{Let \(A\) be a set of integers, rationals, or reals. Prove that b is the least upper bound of A iff:}

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemindent}{.1in}
\item{\((\forall a \in A)(a \leq b)\); and}

\item{whenever \(c<b\) there is an \(a\) such that \(a>c\).}
\textcolor{blue} {.}

\textcolor{blue} {For the first part of the bi-conditional:} 
\textcolor{blue} {Assume \(b\) is the lub of \(A\) and \(\exists a \in A\) such that \(a>b\). Then \(b\) is not the least upper bound. This is a contradiction. Now, assume \(c<b\) and there is not an \(a \in A\) such that \(a>c\). Then \(c\) is an upper bound and is less than the lub. This is a contradiction.}\\ 
\textcolor{blue} {For the second part of the bi-conditional:} 
\textcolor{blue} {Assume \((\forall a \in A)(a\leq b)\). So \(b\) is in \(A\). If \(b\) is not the lub, then \(\exists c, a \leq c < b\). If \(b\) is in \(A\) then it is not the case that \(a \leq b\). If \(b\) is not in \(A\) then there is a contradiction. Now, assume whenever \(c<b\) there is an \(a \in A\) such that \(a>c\). If \(b\) is not the lub, there is a \(c<b\) such that \(c\) is the lub. If \(a>c\) then \(a\) cannot be in \(A\). This is a contradiction}\\ 
\textcolor{blue} {Therefore, both conditionals are proven.}

\end{enumerate}

\item{The following variant of the above characterization is often found. Show that \(b\) is the lub of \(A\) iff:}

\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\itemindent}{.1in}
\item{\((\forall a \in A)(a \leq b)\); and}

\item{\((\forall \epsilon > 0)(\exists a \in A)(a > b-\epsilon)\)}

\textcolor{blue} {(a) is the same as the previous question. For (b):}
\textcolor{blue} {Assume \(b\) is the lub of \(A\) and \((\exists \epsilon>0)(\not\exists a \in A)(a>b-\epsilon)\). This would imply \(b-\epsilon\) is the lub of \(A\), which is a contradiction. Now, assume \((\forall \epsilon >0)(\exists a \in A)(a>b-\epsilon)\) and \(b\) is not the lub. This implies \(\exists \epsilon\) such that \(b-\epsilon)\) is the lub, so \((\forall a \in A)(a \leq b-\epsilon)\). This is a contradiction, thus completing proof of the biconditional for (b).}

\end{enumerate}

\item{Give an example of a set of integers that has no upper bound.}
\textcolor{blue} {The set of integers defined by the natural numbers has no upper bound.}

\item{Show that any finite set of integers/rationals/reals has a least upper bound.}

\textcolor{blue} {Since \(A\) is finite, \(A\) has a maximum element, say \(b\). So \((\forall a\in A)(a \leq b)\). This is the definition of least upper bound.}

\item{Intervals: What is lub \((a,b)\)? What is lub \([a,b]\)? What is max \((a,b)\)? What is max \([a,b]\)}?

\textcolor{blue} {\(b\), \(b\), none, \(b\).}

\item{Let \(A=\{|x-y|, x,y \in (a,b)\}\). Prove that \(A\) has an upper bound. What is lub \(A\)?}

\textcolor{blue} {\(|x-y| \leq |a|+|b|\), so \(|a|+|b|\) is an upper bound.}

\item{Define the notion of a \textit{lower bound} of a set of integers/rationals/reals.}

\textcolor{blue} {\(b\) is a lower bound of \(A\) if and only if \((\forall a \in A)(a\geq b)\).}

\item{Define the notion of a \textit{greatest lower bound} (glb) of a set of integers/rationals/reals by analogy with our original definition of lub.}

\textcolor{blue} {Let \(B\) be the set of all lower bounds of \(A\). \(b\) is the greatest lower bound of \(A\) if and only if \((\forall x \in B)(b\geq x)\).}

\item{State and prove the analog of question 5 for greatest lower bounds.}

\textcolor{blue}{Question skipped: this would follow the same proof methodology as 5, but for greatest lower bound.}

\item{State and prove the analog of question 6 for greatest lower bounds.}

\textcolor{blue}{Question skipped: this would follow the same proof methodology as 6, but for greatest lower bound.}

\item{Show that the Completeness Property for the real number system could equally well have been defined by the statement, "Any nonempty set of reals that has a lower bound has a greatest lower bound"}

\textcolor{blue}{Let \(A\) be a non-empty set \(\in \mathbb{R}\) that is bounded above. The lub defined on the complement of \(A\) (\(A'\)) is now the greatest lower bound of \(A\).}  

\item{The integers satisfy the Completeness Property, but for a trivial reason. What is that reason?}

\textcolor{blue}{Subsets of integers are always closed intervals.}
