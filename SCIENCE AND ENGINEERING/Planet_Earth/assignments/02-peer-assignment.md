**Question**: Consider the concept of a paradigm shift, defined by Thomas Kuhn (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) as a change in the basic assumptions of a science.

**Text:**

A Paradigm shift is a fundamental change in the concepts and practices of a scientific discipline. In contrast to normal scientific practice which takes place within a certain framework of understanding, paradigm shift occurs when that very framework is incompatible with new discoveries or knowledge.

One such example is the development of quantum mechanics replacing classical mechanics at atomic/subatomic scales. Experiments such as Youngâ€™s double-slit experiment led to models of reality (i.e., wave-particle duality) which was incompatible with the classical paradigm.

Paradigm shifts also occur outside of scientific practice. This is the case when scientific shifts make their way into the broader public consciousness as, for instance, with Copernican cosmology. Shifts can also occur in the social and applied sciences, or as a result of a historical or technological event. For example, WWI might be seen as a paradigm shift in historical consciousness as humanity first witnessed industrial-scale warfare. The moon landing or internet could also be viewed as paradigm shifts affecting human society more generally.
