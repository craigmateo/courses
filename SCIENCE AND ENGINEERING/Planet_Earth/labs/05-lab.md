1. [Q#5201]World Oil RegionsProven Oil Reserves, as published by the CIA Factbook, 2009. Source: Wikimedia / EmilfaroOpen Google Earth and check "Borders and Labels"
in the Layers panel. In the Lab 5 folder, check the Major Known Oil Reserves folder and make the entire folder
semi-transparent using the slider at the bottom of the Places panel.Which of the following regions in NOT a location that has major oil reserves?

2. [Q#5202]Which continent presently does NOT have any known oil reserves?



3. [Q#5203]Oil FieldsThe petroleum industry in the United States began in 1859, when a gushing oil well was drilled in Titusville, Pennsylvania. Exploration and production quickly spread to Texas, expanding to surrounding states and then into the Gulf of Mexico.At the Kimball oil field in Nebraska, this pumpjack converts the circular motion of its motor to a seesaw motion that raises oil from underground. 1972.

Drilling of the Ackerly oil field near Lamesa, Texas, began in the 1940s. Map of the Permian Basin. Source: Wikimedia / US Department of EnergyCheck and double-click on placemark Question 3 to fly to the Ackerly oil field. You should see a grid of farm fields and roads dotted with small patches of dirt representing individual oil wells connected to the paved highways. In this part of the US, roads are spaced at 1-mile intervals, outlining areas of 1 square mile called sections. Use the Ruler to determine the size of a section in this view (remember to change the scale of the Ruler to miles).Zoom in to see more clearly. Count the number of oil wells in several different sections, and average your results. Approximately how many oil wells were drilled per square mile in this oil field?

4. [Q#5204]Which of the following factors may influence the spacing of oil wells? Check as many as apply.



5. [Q#5205]Oil TrapsGeologists who explore for oil look for places where petroleum is trapped below an impermeable seal rock. Often, the seal is a layer of shale, while the oil resides in cracks and pore spaces in sandstone or limestone.A simple oil trap formed by folded rock layers. Source: WikipediaOffshore oil fields commonly include oil traps associated with salt deposits. Subsurface salt can flow under pressure, forming complex structures. Sometimes, salt flows upward and pushes overlying layers into a dome shape called a salt dome. Salt that flows into the dome has to come from somewhere else, so layers above a place from which salt flows away sink down to form a basin. As this process continues, oil may become trapped under the edges of the dome, and that is where geologists look for oil depositsSalt dome oil trap. Source: Drawing by E. HerrstromCheck and double-click on placemark Question 5 to visit the Gulf of Mexico, where many oil wells tap deposits around salt domes. What type of feature does this placemark point to?

6. [Q#5206]Check and double-click on placemark Question 6 to visit the Gulf of Mexico, where many oil wells tap deposits around salt domes. What type of feature does this placemark point to?



7. [Q#5207]Check and double-click on placemark Question 7. What kind of structure is this?



8. [Q#5208]Set units to kilometers, and use the Ruler to measure the diameter of the salt dome at placemark Question 7. 



9. [Q#5209]Other Energy SourcesIn addition to fossil fuels (petroleum, natural gas, and coal), there are several other types of energy sources. Many people depend on nuclear power to produce energy, but this comes with numerous problems, such as accidental release of radiation and disposal of radioactive waste. In addition, nuclear energy, like energy from fossil fuels, is non-renewable. Renewable energy sources include:Wind power: Wind turns large blades that drive a turbine to produce electricity.Solar power: Panels collect the Sun's energy for heating or for conversion to electricity.Hydroelectricity: Water flows through turbines that generate electricity.Tidal power:  Incoming and outgoing tides spin turbines to produce electricity.Geothermal energy: Deep wells tap the Earth's internal heat to provide space heating or to power electric turbines.Biofuels: Sugar cane, corn, and other plants may be used to produce liquid fuels, primarily for transportation.Top left to right: Cattenom Nuclear Power Plant in France, Wind farm in Germany, 15 de Septiembre hydroelectric dam in El Salvador.

10. [Q#5210]Check
and double-click on Muppandal to
zoom out to see the entire area of energy generation here. Is this type of energy “green” (renewable, non-polluting) or “not green” (it uses non-renewable  resources and is possibly polluting the environment)?

15. [Q#5215]Check and double-click placemark Question 15 to see the Marstal Power Plant in Denmark. What type of energy source is shown here?



16. [Q#5216]The Marstal power plant is located on Aero Island, whose people are trying to become self-sufficient in energy, and by 2008, they had already achieved 80% reliance on renewable energy. Solar power supplied ~30% of heating needs, which is remarkable when you consider its geographic location. What is the latitude of Marstal?
