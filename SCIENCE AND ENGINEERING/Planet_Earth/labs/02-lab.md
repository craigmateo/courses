# Week 2 Lab

1. [Q#2201]See for yourself!How did geologists come to view the Earth through the lens of plate tectonics?  From the beginnings of geology in the 1700s until the mid-1900s, most earth scientists believed that oceans and continents were permanent and fixed features of the Earth's surface.  This notion began to change in the 1950s with the publication of maps showing features of the sea floor and with more precise location of earthquake epicenters.  Geologists quickly noticed that the spatial distribution of epicenters matches geographic features of the ocean floor. Compare the two maps below to see the kind of data that enabled geologists to trace out tectonic plates.World map showing major and minor tectonic plates.

Source: All-geo / Chris RowanPlate BoundariesGeologists identify three basic types of plate boundaries or margins:Convergent Boundaries or Subduction Zones:In these locations, two plates are moving towards each other.  An oceanic plate can be subducted, which means that it bends downward and descends into the mantle, where it melts.  A subduction zone consists of a deep marine trench, a chain of volcanoes, and abundant seismic activity.  The volcanic chain is called an island arc if one oceanic plate subducts under another oceanic plate.  It is called a volcanic arc if an oceanic plate subducts under a continent.Divergent Boundaries or Oceanic Ridges:These margins are defined by the presence of an oceanic ridge, an undersea mountain range that extends for tens of thousands of kilometers.  At the oceanic ridge, hot magma rises from the mantle to create new oceanic crust, which then moves away from the top of the ridge in a conveyor-belt fashion.  This process is called sea-floor spreading.  There is volcanic activity all along the top of the ridge, but only in a few locations (e.g., Iceland) does the volcanism rise above the surface of the ocean.  Ridges are also defined by seismic activity, although the earthquakes tend to be weaker than those that occur along the two other types of boundaries.Transform Boundaries:These margins are defined by transform faults where one plate slides horizontally past another.  The famous San Andreas Fault in California is a transform fault between the Pacific plate and the North American plate.  Because plate material is generally not created or destroyed here, there is usually no volcanic activity at this kind of plate boundary.  There is, however, plenty of earthquake activity.  Transform margins within oceanic lithosphere abruptly offset the position of the oceanic ridge.  Transform margins within continental lithosphere disrupt the local topography.  Cross-section and block diagrams showing different types of plate boundaries. Source: Wikipedia / Jose F. Vigil. USGSOther Plate Tectonic FeaturesThere are also three other geologic regions at which tectonic activity (earthquakes ± volcanoes ± mountain building) takes place.  These are: Continental Collision Zones:A continental collision zone represents the final stage of a convergent margin where two continents push together for a time after the intervening oceanic lithosphere has been totally subducted.  The Himalayas represent such a zone.  Collisional margins are marked by high mountain ranges.  Continental Rifts:A continental rift represents the beginning stage of a divergent margin where a continent stretches and begins to pull apart.  With time, oceanic crust will begin to be produced at a continental rift.Hot Spots: There is one geologic feature that is not a plate boundary but may look like one.  This is a hot spot, which is a narrow plume of hot mantle rock that rises from deep in the mantle, melts, and feeds a volcano at Earth's surface.  The hot spot is relatively stationary with respect to the moving plate.  As a plate moves over the hot spot, the volcano moves off the plume and becomes extinct, and a new one forms above the plume.  Topographically, these chains resemble oceanic ridges or island arcs, but they are not.  The Hawaiian Islands and submerged Emperor Seamounts in the middle of the Pacific Ocean are a good example of a linear chain of active and extinct volcanoes that were produced by the Pacific Plate moving over a stationary hot spot. Look at the updated digital model of plate boundaries below. Cross-hatched areas have names that are written out in full. Plates have labels that are abbreviations of the name. You can view a list of plate name abbreviations [PDF]. If you live in a part of the world with many small plates, you might need to look at this more detailed map. Zoom in to your town to find the plate name.The 52 plates of model PB2002 are shown with contrasting colors. Source: Peter BirdWhich plate do you live on? Be specific – use the name of any cross-hatched area within a larger plate if possible.

9. [Q#2209]Draw a "best-fit" line through the points, i.e., a straight line that comes close to passing through as many points as possible. A computer spreadsheet can draw such a trendline using a mathematical formula, but you can also draw one by hand, estimating its position by sight.The slope of a best-fit line through all points gives the velocity, or rate of movement, of the Pacific Plate over the mantle plume for the past 64.7 Ma. What does your line indicate about the movement of the Pacific Plate?



10. [Q#2210]Data points that align are known as linear, i.e., the two variables are related by the equation of a line:  y = ax + b, where a = slope of the line and b = y-intercept. In the next several questions, you will figure out the slope of your line, in order to find the rate of movement for the Pacific Plate.On your graph, what are the measurement units for x?



11. [Q#2211]What are the measurement units for y?



12. [Q#2212]In algebra, the slope of a line = rise / run = vertical change / horizontal change.  For your graph, what are the units for the slope?



13. [Q#2213]Now, find the slope of your best-fit line. If you drew the line with the computer, add a trendline to your graph. Put the equation of the trendline into the form y = ax + b, where a = slope. If you drew the line by hand, follow these steps to find the slope of your line:Find the coordinates of two points at opposite ends of the line.Let (x1, y1) represent one point, and let (x2, y2) represent the other point.Calculate the slope using this formula: a = (y2 − y1) / (x2 − x1)Which choice is closest to your slope?



14. [Q#2214]The slope of your trendline represents the velocity of the Pacific Plate.  What is the rate of plate movement?  Include the proper units, which you found in question 12. 



15. [Q#2215]Plate velocities are usually given in units of centimeters per year.Change your velocity in part b to these commonly used units. For example, if the velocity is 50 km/Ma, then 50 km/Ma= 50 km / 1 Ma 	     = 50 km (100,000 cm/km) / 1 Ma 	     = 5,000,000 cm / 1 Ma 	     = 5,000,000 cm / 1,000,000 yr = 5 cm/yrFrom the slope of your best-fit line, what is the velocity of the Pacific Plate, as expressed in cm/yr?



16. [Q# 2216]Relative and Absolute Plate MotionsWe have discussed two ways of determining the rate of plate movement, but we haven't emphasized the difference between them – until now! First, let's review:One way to describe plate movement is to identify the relative motion between two plates.
Definition: the motion of one plate relative to another, across their mutual boundaryExample: using marine magnetic anomalies to determine the rate of sea-floor spreading2. Another way to describe plate movement is to consider the absolute movement of a single plate, with respect to some fixed frame of reference.Definition: the motion of one plate relative to the global grid of latitude and longitude, or as viewed from spaceExample: using the age and distance of Hawaiian volcanoes to determine how fast the Pacific Plate moves over the Hawaii hot spotWhat Is Relative Motion?One way to describe plate movement is to identify the relative motion between two plates, that is to say, the motion of one plate relative to another across their mutual boundary.Let's consider a divergent boundary. When we've looked at mid-ocean ridges before, we have implicitly held the ridge position constant. This is like standing on the ridge itself, which is actually possible in a place such as Iceland. If you're standing on a ridge, that ridge appears to be fixed in position, and the plates on either side are moving away.The Mid-Atlantic Ridge runs through the middle of Iceland. Source: Wikipedia / USGSAssume the spreading rate is 6 cm/yr, that is, the ocean is getting 6 cm wider every year. From your perspective on the ridge, each plate is moving away at a rate of 3 cm/yr.Plate motions relative to a mid-ocean ridge. Source: Drawing by E. HerrstromNow, suppose you travel to the east coast of Iceland, where you'll be standing on the Eurasian Plate. From this viewpoint, the plate you're on appears to be fixed in position. Both the other plate and the ridge itself are moving away from you. The ridge moves at 3 cm/yr, because your plate grows by that much each year. So does the other plate, which means that plate is moving away from you at 6 cm/yr. The ocean still gets wider by 6 cm every year, but the amount and direction of motion appear different, depending on where you stand. That's why this is called relative motion: it's relative to your frame of reference.Both the western plate and the ridge move away from the eastern plate. Source: Drawing by E. HerrstromWhat Is the Relative Motion across a Transform Fault?Similar distinctions apply along transform boundaries: we can consider relative motion with respect to one plate, the other plate, or the boundary itself.A transform fault is vertical, and one plate slides past the other one along the fault. Source: ©The Board of Trustees of the University of IllinoisThe heavy black line represents a transform fault. Suppose some distinctive feature forms across the transform fault. It could be a fresh lava flow, or even a new highway or a building.The blue ring represents some new feature that developed across a transform fault. Source: Drawing by E. HerrstromFor 3 million years, the plates slide past each other along the transform boundary, until the top half of the blue feature is located 120 km to the west of the bottom half. Using R = D / T, the plates have been moving at 4 cm/yr since the blue feature formed.The upper half of the blue ring slides westward along the transform fault. Source: Drawing by E. HerrstromBut which plate moved, and how far? If you're standing on the bottom plate, it seems fixed and the top plate appears to be moving west at 4 cm/yr. But walk over to the top plate, and it now seems fixed, while the other plate moves east at 4 cm/yr. Or you could watch from the space station, and the plates might appear to be moving at 2 cm/yr in opposite directions. It's all relative, you see.Can You Identify the Boundaries?Consider the motions of Plates A and C relative to Plate B. If you're standing on Plate B, Plate A is moving 2 cm/yr toward the west, and Plate C is moving 6 cm/yr toward the east. What type of plate boundary separates A and B? How about B and C?Consider the motions of
Plates A and C relative to Plate B. Suppose that you're standing on Plate B.
Plate A is moving 2 cm/yr toward the west, and Plate C is moving 6 cm/yr toward
the east. What type of plate boundary separates A and B?A, B, and C represent
three plates. The line separating A and B is a plate boundary, and so is the
line separating B and C.
Source: Drawing by E. HerrstromBecause A is moving
away from B, the boundary is divergent. Plate A and Plate B each grow by 1
cm/yr along their boundary, as sea-floor spreading occurs at 2 cm/yr. The
mid-ocean ridge itself moves 1 cm to the west every year, relative to Plate B.What type of boundary
separates Plate B from Plate C?

17. [Q# 2217] Absolute Plate Motions from Satellite MeasurementsBoth marine magnetic anomalies and displacements along transform faults can be used to calculate rates of plate motion, but both give relative motions. They describe only the motions of two plates along their mutual boundary. Relative motions are shown on this map by blue arrows that point away from divergent boundaries and toward convergent boundaries. The length of each arrow represents how fast the movement is. Transform boundaries are not marked here.Relative plate velocities: The blue arrows show the rate and direction at which the plate on one side of the boundary is moving with respect to the plate on the other side. The length of an arrow represents the velocity. Absolute plate velocities: The red arrows show the velocity of the plates with respect to a fixed point in the mantle. Source: Marshak, Essentials of Geology (4th ed.), Figure 2.29The red arrows, on the other hand, represent absolute rates and directions of motion. Absolute values apply to a reference frame that is independent of Earth's surface. The grid of lines of latitude and longitude is such a framework because it doesn't depend on where a measurement is taken (the equator doesn't move as you travel around the world). Or you could think of observing the Earth from space. Then you would see plates moving in the directions of the red arrows. For example, the long red arrows in the Pacific Ocean show that the Pacific Plate is moving rapidly toward the west-northwest, in the direction parallel to the Hawaiian Islands. Thus, hot-spot tracks record absolute motions. Meanwhile, the North American Plate is moving toward the southwest in absolute terms. Yet along the San Andreas Fault, North America is moving south-southeast relative to the Pacific Plate.When a boundary is described as divergent, this is always implied to be in relative terms. Absolute motions, however, may be very different. Consider a mid-ocean ridge that is spreading at a rate of 6 cm/yr, relative to the ridge itself (blue arrows). One way to produce this amount of spreading would be for the ridge to be stationary and the absolute motion of each plate to be 3 cm/yr, in opposite directions (red arrows). In this special case, relative and absolute motions coincide.If a mid-ocean ridge is stationary and spreading symmetrically at 6 cm/yr, then each plate moves away from the ridge at 3 cm/yr. Source: Drawing by E. HerrstromIt is also possible, however, that both plates are moving in the same direction, as illustrated below. If Plate M is moving westward at 8 cm/yr, and Plate N is moving west at 2 cm/yr, the ridge is still spreading at 6 cm/yr. But this time, the ridge is also moving to the west at 5 cm/yr. Where does this rate come from? If the ridge is spreading symmetrically, as they usually do, then every year it moves 2 cm along with Plate N, plus another 3 cm because of the new ocean floor added along the western edge of Plate N.Both plates and the ridge are moving. The difference in absolute motions of the two plates equals the relative spreading rate across the ridge. Source: Drawing by E. HerrstromRecall that the average rate of plate movement is about 5 cm/yr (about how fast fingernails grow). That's perceptible, but only over a long time. You can't see your nails growing from minute to minute, but you notice the increase after a couple of months. Similarly, you can't stand and watch plates move, because they're too slow. In the past 10-15 years, however, it has become possible to measure plate motions by using the Global Positioning System of satellites. The red dots on this map indicate precise locations where GPS measurements are taken regularly. The black arrows point in the direction each dot is moving, and the length of the arrow is proportional to the dot's velocity in absolute terms.The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a set of 30 satellites which are used for navigation and precise geodetic position measurements. On this map, horizontal velocities are represented by lines extending from each site. Source: Wikipedia / NASAThink of this map as a time-lapse photograph. It shows that North America is actually rotating counterclockwise, and Antarctica is moving slowly southward. Eurasia, Africa, and Australia are all moving mostly northeast, at various rates. Geologists can plug data such as this into equations for spherical geometry and calculate relative motions between any pair of plates, even if they don't have a boundary in common!Use this image for questions 17 and 18:A, B, and C identify three different tectonic plates. Relative to B, A is moving 2 cm/yr toward the west, and C is moving 6 cm/yr toward the east. What type of boundary separates B and C?
