# Week 4 Lab

1. [Q#4201]Diamond MinesDiamonds were discovered in 1871 in Kimberley, South Africa, setting off a "diamond rush" of miners to the area. The mine that came to be called the "Big Hole" was excavated with hand tools, by approximately 50,000 miners over about 40 years. These men produced what was at that time the largest hand-dug hole in the world.Looking down into the lowest part of the Big Hole Source: Flickr / Gary BembridgeOpen

2. [Q#4202]The diameter of the Big Hole is your answer from the
previous question. Its original depth was 240 m (although it has been partially
filled in since mining ended). Assume that the entire hole is V-shaped, like a
cone, with a radius of half the diameter and a height equal to the mine depth.Using the formula for the volume of a cone (V = 1/3 π r2 h, where r = radius and h = height = depth), determine the
amount of material that miners removed from the Big Hole by hand.



3. [Q#4203]If the total mass of material removed from the Big Hole was 22 million tonnes (metric
tons), and if all 50,000 men who worked the mine moved equal amounts, how much earth did each miner dig out?



4. [Q#4204]The miners who moved 22 million tonnes of earth uncovered 3000 kg of diamonds in all that dirt. Diamonds made up what percentage of material removed from the Big Hole? (1 tonne = 1000 kg)



5. [Q#4205]Gold ring set with a brilliant cut diamond Source: WikipediaCut diamonds that adorn jewelry may be beautiful, but the process of mining them is not quite so attractive. The region around Kimberley is noted for numerous diamond mines besides the Big Hole. Zoom out to an eye altitude of 15–20 and explore around this area.Check placemarks Question 5, Question 6, and Question 7 and double-click one of them. Here, we see some of the unpleasant parts of the diamond mining process.In Questions 5–7, match each placemark to its description:

7. [Q#4207]Question 7:



8. [Q#4208]South Africa was once the largest producer of diamonds among the countries of the world, but it has been surpassed. Botswana, which borders South Africa on the north, is currently the largest producer, and these two plus many other countries of Africa dominate world production. Search online to find which of the following countries is the largest diamond producer outside of Africa.



9. [Q#4209]Check and double-click on placemarks Question 9a and Question 9b to see the Mir Mine in eastern Siberia, Russia's largest diamond mine. Russian geologists searching for diamonds identified the rocks in this area as kimberlite (named for Kimberley, South Africa, and now considered the most important source rock for these gemstones worldwide).Waste material from the Mir Mine was dumped mainly on the east side of the open pit. Determine the difference in elevation between placemark Question 9a on the waste pile and placemark Question 9b next to the pile. Approximately how high is the waste pile?



10. [Q#4210]Gold MinesNatural resources are plentiful in the state of Western Australia. Near the city of Kalgoorlie, miners worked several small open pit and shaft mines for gold for nearly 100 years starting in 1893. In 1989, a newly formed company bought out and consolidated several smaller operators in the area and now is working this open pit mine, informally known as the Super Pit.A buffer zone of trees along the highway separates Kalgoorlie from the Super Pit Source: Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold MinesCheck and double-click on placemark Question 10 to fly to the Fimiston Mine in Western Australia. Keenly aware of environmental problems associated with mining in general, and open-pit mining specifically, mine operators have undertaken several steps to minimize their impact. Placemark Question 10 is located along the green belt that was established as a buffer zone between the mine and the city of Kalgoorlie and has subsequently been planted with &gt;200,000 trees. Use the Ruler to measure the width of this buffer zone near  placemark Question 10. Pick the closest number to your measurement, using the widest part of the buffer zone.

11. [Q#4211]Mining generates two types of byproducts: waste rock, or non-ore-bearing material that must be removed in order to reach ore, and tailings, or leftovers from the processing mills. Waste rock (lower right) and tailings pond at the Antamina mine in Peru Source: Flickr / Paulo TomazAt the Super Pit, waste rock is either used as concrete aggregate (construction material) or dumped nearby. Waste dumps are subsequently replanted and monitored to rehabilitate and reclaim the land. After the gold has been extracted, tailings remain in the form of a mixture of solid and liquid known as a slurry. This material is piped to holding ponds to dry out. The company monitors surrounding groundwater, vegetation, and birds to ensure the health of the environment.Check

13. [Q#4213]Question 13:



14. [Q#4214]On Niolam Island in Papua New Guinea, gold was discovered relatively recently (1982). The Lihir Mine, opened in 1995, is located within the crater of an extinct volcano right at the shoreline. Because of the mine's remote location, it has been difficult to obtain enough electricity.  Residual volcanic heat produces geothermal power that supplies part of the mine's demand, and fuel oil turbines mounted on barges offshore generate extra power.The Lihir Mine pit.

15. [Q#4215]Because the crater is open on one side (towards the ocean), it resembles:




16. [Q#4216]There is no suitable nearby area on land to dump waste rock from the mining process, and the high seismicity of this region would make such rock piles unstable. Therefore, waste rock is either used for construction or transported by barge for submarine disposal. Similarly, tailings are piped offshore and discharged into very deep water, in a method called deep sea tailings placement. Both types of disposal are monitored for environmental impact.What evidence is visible in Google Earth to show that mine operations are affecting the oceans, in spite of careful handling?



17. [Q#4217]Copper MinesCopper was one of the first metals to be shaped by people, going back at least 10,000 years. We use it today for myriad purposes, from household items to heavy and high-tech industries. In fact, copper is so important to modern society that economists use its price and usage rates to indicate the economic health of a region.Copper swords from the 17th century.

18. [Q#4218]What is the approximate diameter of the mine between placemark Question 17 and placemark Question 18? 



19. [Q#4219]Check and double-click on placemark Question 19. Use the Hand cursor to measure the elevation difference (in m) between placemark Question 18 and placemark Question 19, in order to estimate the depth of the main pit.



20. [Q#4220]Check and double-click placemark Question 20 to visit one of the many tailings piles. For some places around the world, Google Earth provides historical imagery back into the 1990s. To access the older images for this mine, click on the “1997” button in the lower left corner of the main window. The image should change to black and white, and a slider bar should appear in the upper left corner. Move the slider back and forth to observe changes at the mine over time.Check
and double-click on placemark Question 19 again to return to the mine pit. In April and September of 2013, two landslides occurred in the mine. Compare the images for 2011 and 2015 to see where the slides took place. Which part of the mine was affected by the landslides?




21. [Q#4221]Copper mining and refining in northern Chile dates back to at least the sixth century CE (Fuller 2004). Check and double-click on placemark Question 21 and fly to the Chuquicamata Mine near Calama, Chile, on the western slope of the Andes Mountains.Fly completely around the mine are and observe yet another big hole, this one the largest open-pit mine in the world. Could you measure diameter and depth, and use the formula for the volume of a cone to estimate how much material has been mined here, as you did in question 2 for the Kimberley Mine? (There is one correct answer, but some other answers might give you partial credit.)




22. [Q#4222]Prior to about 1910, Chilean miners were extracting high-grade ore, with copper concentrations of 10–15% of the bulk volume of rock. By the twentieth century, they were mining low-grade ore, containing only 2–3% copper.What changes would have made it economically feasible to continue mining after the high-grade ore was gone? Check as many as apply.
