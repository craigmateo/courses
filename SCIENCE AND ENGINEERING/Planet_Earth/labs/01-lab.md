7. Travel-Time CurveBecause P-waves travel faster than S-waves, the difference in arrival time between the two waves increases with increasing distance.  As an analogy, imagine a car and a bicycle traveling along a highway – the longer they travel, the farther ahead the car will be.  Seismologists use this relationship between distance and difference in P- and S-wave arrival times to determine the distance from an earthquake epicenter to a recording seismograph.  The relationship can be summarized on a diagram called a travel-time curve.A travel-time curve plots the time it takes a wave to travel from the earthquake focus to a position on the Earth's surface a given distance away.  Seismologists have calculated travel-time curves from many different earthquakes and found that the curves do not differ significantly from each other.  Hence, the best average travel-time curve, computed from a large number of records, is approximately valid anywhere on the Earth. Figure 2 summarizes epicenter data from around the world.  There is a travel-time curve for both the P-wave and for the S-wave; distance is plotted on the x-axis and time on the y-axis.  Suppose that for a certain earthquake, the S-wave is observed to arrive 6 minutes after the P-wave.  Since time is measured in the vertical direction, find the place where the vertical separation between the two curves is equal to 6 minutes, as illustrated.  Then project downward to the x-axis to get the distance to the epicenter, or project horizontally to the y-axis to find the time it took for either wave to arrive.  Based on Figure 2, the earthquake under consideration
occurred at a distance of 1800 km from the seismometer; the P-wave arrived 4 ½  minutes after the earthquake occurred, and the
S-wave arrived 3 minutes later, or 7 ½  minutes after the quake began. If the actual
arrival time of the S-wave is known, e.g., 10:00 AM, then subtract travel time
from arrival time to find out when the earthquake occurred: 10:00 AM – 7 ½
minutes = 9:52:30 AM. Note that you could also determine the time of the
earthquake by using the P-wave, instead of the S-wave.Figure 2. How to read a travel time curve. Source: E. HerrstromFor questions 7–12, use the travel-time curve on page 4 of the PDF.

13. TriangulationIn order to find the epicenter of an earthquake, you need information on arrival time from at least three different seismic stations, plus a protractor for drawing circles.  If you know the distance to the epicenter from only one station, then the epicenter could be anywhere on a circle centered on that station.  With distance data from a second station, you can narrow this down to either of two points of intersection of the circles.  Finally, with three stations, you can pinpoint the location. When using three or more stations, the circles should theoretically meet in a single point, as shown in Figure 3.  However, in practice, you choose a location close to the intersection of all the circles, and label this as the epicenter.Figure 3. Triangulation of an earthquake. Source: E.

15. Magnitude of an EarthquakeThe magnitude of an earthquake measures the amount of energy released. This is based on the largest wave amplitude recorded on a seismogram, with a correction for the distance between the seismometer and the epicenter.  You can determine the magnitude of an earthquake graphically by using a nomogram (Figure 4).  Draw a line connecting the epicenter distance (on the left scale) with the largest amplitude of the S-wave.  The center scale gives magnitude.Figure 4. Nomogram for determining magnitude. If a seismometer located 300 km from the epicenter recorded a seismogram with maximum amplitude 2 mm, then the magnitude of the quake was 4.2. Source: E. HerrstromUse the larger version of Figure 4 on page 5 of the PDF for questions 15–21.On the seismogram for Buenos Aires, measure the amplitude of the highest wave.
