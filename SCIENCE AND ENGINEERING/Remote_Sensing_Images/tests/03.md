1. Choose all the correct answers below.

- [x] The principal components transform is a good feature selection techniques when the data classes tend to be distributed along the main diagonal of the feature space.
That is correct, because that diagonal tends to be the first principal axis.
- [x] See figure 1 in the instruction sheet, which is a covariance matrix in image form for data from a hyperspectral sensor.  Block (a) indicates that there is high correlation among the first 35 bands of data.
That is correct
- [ ] See figure 1 in the instruction sheet, which is a covariance matrix in image form for data from a hyperspectral sensor.  Block (b) indicates that there is strong water absorption between bands 35 and 72..
- [ ] Feature reduction is an important step in remote sensing image classification because it means we can then use any classification algorithm and expect good results.

2. Examine the error matrix in Figure 2 of the instruction sheet and choose the correct answers below.

- [x] The average user's accuracy is 77.3%
Yes that is correct.
- [ ] The average producer's accuracy is the same as the average user's accuracy.
- [ ] The overall classification accuracy is given by averaging the row and column sums.
- [x] The class prior probabilities can be calculated from the column sums.
Yes that is correct.  The column sums are the totals from each ground cover class; we assume that the selected reference data reflects the actual scene proportions.
- [x] The overall classification accuracy is 77.3%
That is correct. It is the sum of the diagonal entries divided by 441 for this example.

3. Choose the correct answers below.

- [x] The forward velocity of an imaging radar platform has to be synchronised with the rate at which the ranging pulses are transmitted so that continuous coverage of the terrain  can be achieved.
That is correct
- [ ] The look angle is the same as the incidence angle in an imaging radar system.
- [ ] The radar cross section of a  resolution element is the same as its scattering coefficient.
- [ ] Speckle in a radar image is caused by the presence of large dominant scatterers in all resolution elements.
- [x] The duration of the ranging pulse defines the range resolution of an imaging radar system
That is correct

4. See figure 3 in the instruction sheet and choose the correct answers below

- [ ] The two lines of white dots in the bottom image just above the white arrow are satellites passing under the radar platform.
- [ ] The two lines of white dots in the bottom image just above the white arrow are oil platforms behaving as dihedral corner reflectors
- [ ] The two lines of white dots in the bottom image just above the white arrow are a two moving ships being detected by successive sets of ranging pulses
- [x] Sea surface features are more easily seen in the top image because the smaller incidence angle gives a smaller wave number in the sea surface spectrum.
That is correct
- [ ] Sea surface features are more easily seen in the top image because on the day of acquisition there were strong winds.
- [ ] Terrain relief is less evident in the bottom image because of the radar illumination direction.
- [x] Ignoring the relief distortion, the shading visible in the land surface in the bottom image is the result of the stronger dependence of surface scattering on surface roughness at larger incidence angles
That is correct.

5. Choose the correct answers below.

- [x] Shadows are not a problem for bistatic radar.
That is incorrect.  Whenever the incident radiation cannot illuminate a region behind an object a shadow forms, irrespective of the direction of scatter.
- [ ] Radar tomography allows topographic detail to be tracked in time.
- [ ] Radar tomogarphy requires some penetration into the medium being imaged
- [ ] The altitude of the radar platform is important in topographic change detection in along-track interferometry.
- [ ] Relief distortion occurs in both ground range and slant range imagery
- [x] A good general purpose look angle to use in an imaging radar system for land studies would be about 35 degrees.
Yes that is correct.  At small angles there is less discrimination of surface roughness variations and terrain distortion becomes a significant problem, whereas if it is too large shadowing becomes a problem.

6. Examine figure 4 in the instruction sheet and choose the correct answers below

- [ ] The multiple images of the bridge are the result of several separate carriageways crossing the water.
- [x] The multiple images of the bridge are the result of several different pathways for the incident radar imagery to reflect bask to the radar platform.
That is correct
- [x] The very high resolution evident on the main image of the bridge arch projected onto the water is higher than one would expect and is thus the result of operating the radar in the spotlight mode.  Note that the (very faint) pillars seen joining the roadway to the arch are about 0.5m wide.
That is correct.
- [ ] The very high resolution evident on the main image of the bridge arch projected onto the water is about what would be expected at X band. Note that the (very faint) pillars seen joining the roadway to the arch are about 0.5m wide.
