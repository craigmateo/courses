1. Moisture content is a major factor affecting radar scattering from surfaces because (choose one):

- [ ] it increasingly makes the surface look specular
- [x] it affects the surface dielectric constant
- [ ] evaporating moisture interferes with the incident radar beam
That is correct.

2. Sub-surface radar imaging is possible if (choose one):

- [ ] short wavelengths are used
- [x] long wavelengths are used and the material is dry
- [ ] medium wavelengths are used and the surface-air interface is very smooth
That is correct.  It is under those conditions that best penetration is possible.

3. In radar imaging the Rayleigh criterion is useful for assessing whether (choose one):

- [x] a surface is likely to behave as smooth
- [ ] volume scattering will dominate over surface scattering
- [ ] surface scattering will dominate over volume scattering
That is correct.

4. Which of the following scattering mechanisms has the weakest dependence on incidence angle?

- [ ] smooth surface scattering
- [ ] rough surface scattering
- [x] volume scattering
That is correct.

5. When imaging a forest with SAR, if you wanted the response to be dominated by the canopy, with little or no contribution from the trunks or ground what wavelength would you use?

- [x] X band
- [ ] C band
- [ ] P band
That is correct.  It will give maximum return from the canopy with little penetration to the woody matter or ground

6. Which of the following mechanisms is regard as a strong scatterer in remote sensing radar imaging?

- [ ] a rough surface
- [x] a dihedral corner reflector
- [ ] a wet, smooth surface
That is correct.  A corner reflector is a classic strong scatterer.

7. The radar response of a forest at long wavelengths will be strongly affected by the surface on which the forest sits if (choose one):

- [ ] the forest floor is covered by a volume scattering understory
- [x] the forest floor is a strong specular reflector
- [ ] the forest floor is very rough
That is correct.

8. Sea surface features are best detected with SAR (choose one):

- [x] at a low incidence angle with C or L band imagery
- [ ] at low incidence angle with X band imagery
- [ ] at high incidence angle with P band imagery
That is correct.

9. The cardinal effect is caused by (choose one):

- [x] changing alignments of rows of strong scatterers with respect to the incoming radar beam
- [ ] wind rippling of the surface of sea water
- [ ] strong scatterers underneath tree canopies
That is correct.

10. Oil slicks can be detected in SAR imagery because (choose one);

- [ ] oil has a high dielectric constant
- [ ] oil is a volume scatterer whereas the ocean surface is a Bragg scatterer
- [x] Oil dampens the capillary waves that the radar energy couple into
That is correct
