1. To minimise shadowing in SAR imagery we should use (choose one):

- [ ] short wavelengths
- [x] small look angles
- [ ] large look angles
That is correct.

2. To minimise terrain relief distortion, including layover, in SAR imagery we should use (choose one):

- [ ] short wavelengths
- [ ] small look angles
- [x] large look angles
That is correct

3. Compressional distortion of SAR imagery in the near range (choose one):

- [x] is not a problem for slant range imagery
- [ ] is not a problem for ground range imagery
- [ ] is a problem for both slant and ground range imagery.
That is correct.

4. radar interferometry involves (choose one):

- [ ] measuring the actual the phase angle of the transmitted signal at the point of reflection from the ground
- [x] comparing (by subtraction) the phase angles between the scattered waves resulting from two different radar transmitters
- [ ] reducing speckle
That is correct.

5. Phase flattening is important in radar interferometry (choose one):

- [ ] to remove phase variations due to topographic height variations
- [ ] to ensure phase difference is expressed in radians
- [x] to remove phase variations due to position across the swath
That is correct.

6. DInSAR (choose one):

- [x] is a mechanism in which the effect of phase changes due to fixed topography can be compensated for when looking for phase changes resulting from changes in topography with time
- [ ] requires the use of several different polarisations
- [ ] cannot be used through clouds
That is correct.

7. Radar tomography is a technique that (choose one):

- [ ] Maps topographic change
- [x] allows vertical structure to be detected
- [ ] allows imaging inside structures such as buildings
That is correct.

8. Spotlight mode SAR (choose one):

- [ ] uses a strong transmitter with which to irradiate the earth's surface
- [ ] uses several different radar platforms to irradiate the earth's surface
- [x] allows higher spatial resolution in a smaller region of interest.
That is correct.

9. Use of optical and radar imagery of the same geographical region together is desirable because (choose one):

- [x] we can often identify the class labels of pixels, unable to be found using either image type on its own
- [ ] one can fill in gaps in the spatial coverage of the other platform
- [ ] in fact, there is little benefit in using the two together
That is correct

10. Active radar calibrators can be used (choose the most appropriate):

- [ ] To provide artificial control points in radar imagery
- [ ] To provide a means for radiometrically calibrating radar imagery
- [x] to provide artificial control points and a means for radiometrically calibrating radar imagery
