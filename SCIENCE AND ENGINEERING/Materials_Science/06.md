1.  The ductile-to-brittle transition was first discovered in conjunction with the failure of ______________.

- [x] Liberty Ships
- [ ] the Queen Mary
- [ ] the Titanic

Some of these World War II ships failed in a brittle
fashion when sailing in cold waters, leading to the understanding of the
phenomenon known as the ductile-to-brittle transition.

2. The impact energy is an indicator of
whether a fracture is ductile or brittle, as measured by the ____________ test.

- [ ] tensile
- [x] Charpy
- [ ] creep

This test that involves the fracture of a notched
specimen by impact with a pendulum hammer essentially conducts a full tensile
test in a split second.

3. Although they have equally high atomic
packing densities, face-centered cubic (fcc) metals with more slip systems are
typically ductile while hexagonal close packed (hcp) metals are relatively __________.

- [ ] weak
- [ ] strong
- [x] brittle

The 3 slip systems for hcp metals compared to 12 for
fcc accounts for the relatively brittle nature of hcp metals.

4. Body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys such as
low-carbon steels demonstrate the ductile-to-brittle transition because their
dislocation motion tends to be ___________ than that in the more densely packed
fcc alloys.

- [x] slower
- [ ] faster
- [ ] more erratic
