1. An edge dislocation corresponds to an extra ______________.

- [x] half-plane of atoms
- [ ] full plane of atoms
- [ ] cluster of atoms

The dislocation is along the edge of the extra half
plane. 

2. 

An edge dislocation is a linear defect with the
Burgers vector _______________ to the dislocation line.


- [x] perpendicular
- [ ] parallel
- [ ] at a 45 degree angle

This orientation became apparent when we drew a loop
around the edge dislocation and found the closure (Burgers) vector to be perpendicular to the dislocation line.

3. Crushing an empty soda can made of aluminum alloy is an example of ______________.

- [x] plastic deformation
- [ ] elastic deformation
- [ ] viscous deformation

And, we now see that the overall plastic (permanent)
deformation is the result of numerous dislocations being moved in response to
the stress application.

4. Plastic deformation by dislocation
motion is a ___________ alternative to deforming a defect-free crystal
structure.

- [ ] high-stress
- [x] low-stress
- [ ] stress-free

The energy required to move a dislocation is substantially
less than that required to slide planes of atoms past one another in the
absence of such defects.
