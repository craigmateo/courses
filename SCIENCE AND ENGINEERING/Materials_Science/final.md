# Ten Things Final

1. The first three categories introduced in
the opening of the course (metals, polymers, and ceramics) are based on the
three types of primary bonding: metallic, covalent, and ____________,
respectively.

- [x] ionic
- [ ] van der Waals
- [ ] hydrogen


This direct correlation between primary bonding and engineering
materials categories covers three of the six types of materials covered in this
course.

2. In illustrating the relationship between
atomic structure and the elastic modulus or stiffness of a metal (structure
leads to properties!), we saw how elastic deformation follows from the
stretching of atomic ___________. 

- [ ] energy
- [ ] weights
- [x] bonds

Structure (changes in the atomic bond length in this
case) does lead to a property (the elastic modulus).

3. The _________ plot is a linear set of data points in
which the logarithm of rate is plotted against the inverse of absolute
temperature in K-1.


- [ ] fatigue
- [x] Arrhenius
- [ ] TTT

This important plot was seen in various materials
science applications beyond its role in chemical reaction rates.

4. In the face centered cubic
structure of aluminum, solid-state diffusion occurs by individual aluminum
atoms hopping into adjacent interstitial sites.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

The interstitial
sites in the close-packed face-centered cubic (fcc) structure are too small to
accommodate aluminum atoms. Diffusion occurs by atoms hopping into adjacent
vacant sites.

5. 

___________________ is a linear defect with the
Burgers vector perpendicular to the dislocation line.

- [ ] A vacancy
- [x] An edge dislocation
- [ ] An interstitial

We use the edge dislocation to illustrate the role of
linear defects in plastic deformation.

6. Consider the body of an automobile made
of steel. A small dent in that structure when the automobile is accidentally
driven into a barrier is an example of _________ deformation.

- [ ] elastic
- [x] plastic
- [ ] viscous
​ 
And, we now see that the overall plastic (permanent)
deformation is the result of numerous dislocations being moved in response to
the stress on impact with the barrier.

7. In the tensile test, the yield strength
(Y.S.) is found just beyond the linear elastic region (which gives the elastic
modulus, E) at an offset of 0.2%
strain.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

The yield strength is an important indication of the
stress level that a material can withstand without undergoing significant
plastic (permanent) deformation.

8. Beyond the tensile strength (T.S.), the
maximum stress value measured over the range of the tensile test, we measure the
ductility corresponding to the total amount of ______________ deformation.

- [x] plastic
- [ ] elastic 
- [ ] elastic + plastic

The strain at failure corresponds to the total amount
of plastic deformation. (Elastic deformation is recovered by the “snap back.”)

9. For high temperature creep deformation
in metal alloys, a common mechanism that we illustrated is ______________.

- [ ] viscous flow (molecules sliding past one another)
- [ ] grain boundary sliding
- [x] dislocation climb


10.  


A powerful use of the Arrhenius relationship is to
measure creep data at high temperatures over conveniently short time periods
and then extrapolate the data to __________ temperatures, allowing us to
predict the performance of the material over long operating times.


- [ ] even higher
- [x] low
- [ ] cryogenic

The thermally activated plastic deformation known as
“creep” is an especially good use of the predictive power of the Arrhenius
relationship.

11.  The impact energy is the standard property for monitoring the ductile-to-brittle transition. The impact energy is commonly measured by means of the ______________.

- [x] Charpy test  
- [ ] creep test
- [ ] tensile test

This test involves the fracture of a notched specimen
by impact with a pendulum hammer. Greater impact energy corresponds to greater
ductility.

12. Body-centered cubic (bcc) alloys tend to
exhibit the ductile-to-brittle transition because they have fewer slip systems
than in the ductile face-centered cubic (fcc) alloys.

- [ ] True
- [x] False

In fact, both bcc and fcc alloys have 12 slip systems.
The ductile-to-brittle transition is associated with the fact that the
dislocation motion in bcc alloys tends to be slower than that in the more
densely packed fcc alloys.

13. The design plot is composed of two
intersecting segments: yield strength corresponding to ___________ and fracture
toughness corresponding to flaw-induced fracture.

- [x] general yielding
- [ ] high-temperature fracture
- [ ] fracture following multiple stress applications

This intersection defines the critical flaw size for
the system.

14. The design plot monitors stress as a function of ______________.

- [x] flaw size, a.
- [ ] strain
- [ ] time

This plot allows the monitoring of the critical
transition between general yielding and catastrophic fast fracture.

15. A metal alloy known to have good
ductility is used in the manufacture of a spring in a garage door assembly. The
spring breaks catastrophically after 10 years of regular use, under a load known
to correspond to about one half of the alloy’s yield strength. This is a good
example of fatigue failure.

- [x] True
- [ ] False

The occurrence of catastrophic fast fracture after a
large number of load cycles (garage door openings and closings) is a good
example of fatigue failure.

16. The relationship of fatigue to the design
plot (introduced in our discussion of fracture toughness) is that we grow the
size of a flaw at a relatively low stress until the flaw size reaches the ______________
segment of the design plot. 

- [x] flaw-induced fracture
- [ ] general yielding
- [ ] yield stress


17.  

Phase diagrams are maps that help us track
microstructural development during the slow cooling of an alloy. The Fe-Fe3C
(iron carbide) phase diagram is an example of a ______________ diagram, with
special relevance to steelmaking.


- [ ] temperature versus time
- [ ] eutectic
- [x] eutectoid

The eutectoid or “eutectic-like” reaction is central
to understanding steelmaking.

18.  Quenching a eutectoid steel below about 200
°C initiates the formation of martensite because the _______________ the
austenite phase has become too great.

- [ ] diffusion of carbon within
- [x] instability of
- [ ] specific volume of

The more stable crystallographic form, martensite,
begins to form, and the fraction of martensite increases as we cool further.

19. Electronic conduction in an _____________
semiconductor is the result of the promotion of an electron from the valence
band up to the conduction band across an energy band gap. 

- [x] intrinsic
- [ ] eccentric
- [ ] extrinsic

Impurities in extrinsic semiconductors provide
intermediate levels (such as the donor level in our n-type semiconductor
example) that provide energy promotions less than the full band gap.

20. Combining the extrinsic behavior with
the intrinsic on the Arrhenius plot produces a stable level of conductivity at ______________
temperatures. 

- [ ] relatively high
- [ ] relatively low
- [x] intermediate
