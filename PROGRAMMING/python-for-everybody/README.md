**1. Installing Python**

The first task is to work through the installation steps including installing Python and text editor.

**2. Why Program?**

We learn why one might want to learn to program, and look at the basic issues with learning to program.

**3. Variables, expressions and statements**

We learn how to make variables and store data in those variables.

**4. Conditional Execution**

We look at how Python executes some statements and skips others.

**5. Functions**

Take a brief look at how Python implements the 'store and use later' programming pattern.

**6. Loops and Iterations**

We look at how Python repeats statements using looping structures.

**7. Strings**

We look at how Python stores and manipulates textual data using string variables and functions.

**8. Files**

We learn how to open data files on your computer and read through the files using Python.

**9. Lists**

We look at Python's simplest data structure - the list. Lists can store more than one item in a variable.

**10. Dictionaries**

The dictionary data structures allows us to store multiple values in an object and look up the values by their key.

**11. Tuples**

The tuple is a Python data structure that is like a simple and efficient list.

**12. Regular Expressions**

Regular Expressions allow us to search for patterns in strings and extract data from strings using the regular expression programming language.

**13. Network Programming**

We take a quick look at how data moves across the network using the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP) and how we write programs to read data across the network.

**14. Using Web Services**

Web services allow a program to access data available in a different server.

**15. Object-Oriented Programming**

We do a quick look at how Python supports the Object-Oriented programming pattern.

**16. Databases**

Databases give us very fast random access to large amounts of data. There is a lot of material in this chapter as we learn the Structured Query Language (SQL).

**17. Data Visualization**

In this section, we learn to scrape data from the network, store the data in a
