# Quiz Satisfaction

1. Consider the sentences $$p \lor q \lor r$$ $$p \implies q \land r$$ $$p \implies \neg r$$

There are three proposition constants here, meaning that there are eight possible truth assignments. How many of these assignments satisfy all of these sentences?

| p  | q  | r  | $p \lor q \lor r$ | $p \implies q \land r$  | $p \implies \neg r$ |
