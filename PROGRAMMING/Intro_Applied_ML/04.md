1. Which of the following statements about the Machine Learning Process Lifecycle are true? (click all that apply)

- [ ] Steps can easily be skipped if they’re taking too long
- [x] A clearly defined process helps with communication

- [ ] Documentation isn’t important if the QuAM is being built and used internally
- [x] Having a clear, specific question for the QuAM to answer is an important part of the first phase

- [ ] The first phase considers exactly what features are going to be used
- [ ] Looking at whether you can answer your questions based on the data you have is part of the final phase.
- [ ] &nbsp;Lifecycle re-sets are easy to anticipate
- [x] Iteration is almost always a given; an ML project is rarely straight-forward and linear

- [x] Testing the QuAM is an important part of the Machine Learning and Model Evaluation phase

- [ ] Data wrangling is only a small part of an ML project

2. W​hat does it mean to work backwards through the  ML Process in oder to define a question?

- [ ] S​tart with the learning data you have, define the question you want your QuAM to answer, choose an algorithm.
- [x] S​tart from the broadest business outcome, identify actions that accomplish that outcome, identify questions that support those actions, refine the question.
- [ ] S​tart with the answer you want your QuAM to give, decide on the algorithm, then define operational data.
- [ ] S​tart with the required action, identify impact on the business goals, define and refine a question

C​orrect! Well done!

3. Why might a business choose to use a QuAM that has lower accuracy than the current system?

- [x] Because the QuAM can do the task much faster than the humans can, and a faster process is highly advantageous for the business
C​orrect! The time savings from using ML can be more important than perfect accuracy.
- [ ] Because your business needs to have machine learning to survive in the modern age
- [x] Because the employees hate doing the task, and handing it off to a machine frees them to do other useful things
C​orrect! Best use of human time is an important consideration when analyzing use of ML.
- [x] B​ecause the QuAM does the job adequately and provides other benefits

- [ ] Because the cost of developing the QuAM was high, and the business doesn’t want to waste that time and money

4. W​hy is it important to have a hold-out test set?

- [ ] A) I​t is important to test your QuAM’s ability to generalize before deploying it
- [ ] B) It’s important to protect the integrity of the test data so that you have confidence in the performance of your QuAM
- [ ] C) Your QuAM is going to have to answer questions about unseen data, so you need to test it on unseen data
- [ ] A​ and B
- [x] A​, B and C


5. Which of the following statements are true? (click all that apply)

- [ ] A true positive means someone is pregnant
- [ ] False negatives are always a bigger problem than false positives
- [x] Telling a patient that they have cancer when they don’t is a false positive

- [ ] Telling a patient that they have cancer when they don’t is a false negative
- [x] True positives and true negatives are correct predictions
