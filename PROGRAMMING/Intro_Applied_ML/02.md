1. Machine learning systems do things like mistake a woman's hair for a cat, or think that the name of a band from Montreal could be part of a familiar saying because:

- [ ] The question the QuAM was answering was too specific
- [ ] QuAMs are able to generalize
- [x] They might have had limited training data

C​orrect! The amount of training data impacts the accuracy of the system.

- [x] Because of the learning algorithm being used

C​orrect! The kinds of answers a QuAM gives depend heavily on the learning algorithm used to build them.

2. Why are features important?

- [ ] They describe important characteristics of the data.
- [ ] They are used by a QuAM to distinguish between categories
- [ ] They can filter out irrelevant data
- [x] All of the above

C​orrect! Features capture signal from the raw data, and are used by the QuAM to perform its task. One function of features can be to filter out irrelevant information.

3. What are some of the considerations you need to keep in mind about your QuAM for when you’re using it on operational data? (click all that apply)

- [x] For some applications like legal rulings, explainability is important

Correct, some applications may require models to be human-interpretable.

- [ ] For all applications, the effects of the QuAM are far less relevant than what the system costs
- [x] F​or some applications, the operations of the QuAM can cause the operating environment to change, making the QuAM inaccurate or ineffective.

C​orrect! You need to consider how use of the QuAM will change the operating environment.

- [x] For some applications there is a minimum standard of accuracy needed, and less than that standard makes the QuAM useless

Correct! You should consider what level of accuracy you need for your QuAM to be useful in operation.
- [ ] For some applications like medical diagnosis, the bedside manner of the QuAM is more important than accuracy.
- [x] For some applications, the QuAM's performance must be verified, which may mean setting up a parallel system

Correct! Running a QuAM on live data to verify performance against the existing system can be useful.

4. W​hat are some of the important questions when it comes to QuAM performance and business evaluation? (check all that apply)

- [x] W​hat is acceptable performance?

Correct! Good job!
- [x] W​hat is the cost of making a mistake?

Correct! Good job!
- [ ] A​re you using the latest technology?
- [x] W​hat does success look like?

Correct! Good job!
- [ ] W​hat is ideal performance?
- [ ] H​ow do we get perfect performance?
- [x] A​re you measuring what you think you're measuring?

Correct! Good job!
- [ ] H​ow are you performing by your current metrics?

5. W​hat should you prefer a simple proxy?

- [ ] I​t is easier to measure.
- [ ] I​mprovements in a simple metric are likely to be real improvements to start with.
- [ ] A​ simple proxy is easier to validate as measuring what you think it's measuring.
- [x] A​ll of the above

C​orrect, well done!
