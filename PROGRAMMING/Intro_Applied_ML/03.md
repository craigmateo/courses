1. W​hich of the following are sources of data that can be used for machine learning? (click all that apply)

- [x] R​eadings from sensors such as temperature, pressure, pH monitors, etc.

- [x] G​overnment data such as census results.

- [ ] P​ersonal data collected without permission
- [x] Data collected by a business about their own operations

- [x] Data collected by a business about their customers

- [x] Text data from the Internet, such as Amazon reviews or Wikipedia

- [ ] Data handwritten in a notebook
- [x] Government archives

- [x] Data purchased from third party data "brokers"


1. Which of the following are issues of ethics and responsibility in machine learning? (click all that apply)

- [x] The representativeness of the data

- [x] &nbsp;The anonymization of the data, as much as is possible

- [x] The fair treatment of the people collecting and processing the data

- [x] The security of the data, so that it isn't easily lost or stolen

- [x] The proper consent of the original owners of the data


3. How can data be biased? (click all that apply)

- [ ] It can't; data is data and it reflects the real world
- [x] It might include data collected under different conditions, and so not reflect operational data

- [x] &nbsp;It might not include enough training data on a range of gender and ethnic groups, and so not reflect operational data

- [x] It might not include data from underrepresented socioeconomic groups, and so not reflect real-world data


4. W​hat is the batch effect?

- [ ] When hospitals don't have the same scan results
- [x] When data from different sources have variations that aren't meaningful, but the algorithm takes as meaningful
- [ ] When you train your QuAM several times in different batches
- [ ] When data from different times have included measurements of different things


5. W​hich of the following statements are true about data and data pipelines?

- [x] T​ransformed data will need to be accessible to your QuAM

- [x] I​ntegrating data from multiple sources can cause formatting issues

- [x] Machine learning is an ongoing process, so new, incoming data is important

- [ ] Automating data retrieval is a straight-forward process
- [ ] Long term data storage is never a concern
- [x] Features that were used in the learning data must be present in operational data

- [x] L​earning data and operational data need to be in the same format
