1. What is Artificial Intelligence?

- [ ] Computers with human-level or superhuman intelligence
- [ ] An algorithm

- [x] A sub-field of computer science
Correct! AI is a long-established research area in computing science. 
- [x] Expert systems or search, for example
Correct! Expert systems and search are both examples of AI.
- [ ] &nbsp;Anything intelligent that isnâ€™t human
- [x] Getting computers to behave better without explicitly programming every little thing

Correct! A crucial component of AI is the idea of programming systems that find solutions rather than requiring hyper specification of a solution.

2. What is Machine Learning?

- [ ] Machines that learn like humans do
- [ ] Magic
- [x] Computers learning from existing examples to guess well on new examples
- [ ] Computers learning to do tasks perfectly

Correct! Machine learning systems use data to build systems that extrapolate beyond seen examples.

3. The difference between Data Science and Machine Learning is:

- [ ] Data science is always about providing insights into data patterns;  machine learning is never about providing insights
- [ ] Data science never builds models; machine learning always builds models
- [x] Data science is about extracting insights; machine learning is about generalizing from data

Correct! Nicely Done! Data science uses data to extract insights and value. Machine learning builds systems that can predict answers on unseen data.

4. What is a QuAM?

- [ ] A Quote Action Media
- [x] A Question-Answering Machine
- [ ] A Quality Assurance Model
- [ ] A Quest for All Meaning

Correct! QuAM is the abbreviation for the model that machine learning algorithms build from data.
