## About this Specialization

 Backend refers to the server side of development. Here, the primary focus is on how a website works. Node.js is considered efficient for the development of backend applications as it brings event-driven programming and enables development of fast and efficient web servers in JavaScript. Developers can create scalable servers by using a simplified model of event-driven programming that uses call-backs to signal completion of a task.     

## Courses

**1. Server side JavaScript with Node.js**

Have you ever wondered how you are able to do net banking or book a ticket online? Which technology is adopted for applications used in different businesses? 

Backend technology acts as a backbone to every web application. It typically includes all services, data interfaces and their core business logic. This course will introduce you to the Node.js environment and help you design and develop backend or server-side of the application. It also provides you with hands on coding exercises and will enable you to build JavaScript programs and test and execute them in the Node.js environment.

**2. Building RESTful APIs Using Node.js and Express**

For newly emerged technologies, REST APIs provide a flexible and easier process to integrate applications. They have emerged as one of the most common methods used for connecting components of the distributed system. For a backend developer, ability to build REST APIs is a key requirement.

This course will enable you to build and document REST APIs using various frameworks and tools. The primary use of this is to create REST APIâ€™s that accept request from frontend and send appropriate responses. Here, you will also learn to document the REST APIs using Swagger.

**3. Implement Polyglot Persistence Using SQL and NoSQL Databases**

Have you ever wondered what happens to the registration details after you click on the submit button or to the order details once you press the confirm order button when you try to access any website? From where do you think, the details of the product catalogue are fetched to be displayed on the browser?

All dynamic or interactive applications should be able to store the details provided by the user and retrieve them when requested. Most websites require a database. This course will take you through the process of creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data using SQL and NoSQL databases. It also challenges you with hands-on practices that enable you to perform database operations using shell commands and GUI tools.

**4. Build and Implement Microservices Patterns**

Do you think an e-commerce application can be created as one large application?

Imagine there is an ongoing sale, or some new features are to be added. How, according to you are the changes made visible on the application?  Microservices is a cloud-based architectural approach. It contains loosely coupled, and independently deployable smaller services that are put together cohesively to develop and work on larger, and more complex applications. This approach is being increasing recognized among the business leaders of today, as it helps them structure their operation model and manage their teams according to their requirements. This course will enable you to create an application using multiple microservices. It will provide you hands-on practice on building microservices using Node.js and help establish communication between the microservices.

**5. Capstone Project Using Node.js**

The Capstone Project gives you an opportunity to revisit the concepts covered and develop a workable solution for the given problem statement using the best practices. The solution needs to be developed in accordance with the industry standards within the stipulated time and must be based on the guidelines provided.
