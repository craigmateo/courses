'''
1. The computer must select a word at random from the list of available words
that was provided in words.txt
Note that words.txt contains words in all lowercase letters.
2. The user is given a certain number of guesses at the beginning.
3. The game is interactiveÍ¾ the user inputs their guess and the computer either:
a. reveals the letter if it exists in the secret word
b. penalize the user and updates the number of guesses remaining
4. The game ends when either the user guesses the secret word, or the user runs
out of guesses.
