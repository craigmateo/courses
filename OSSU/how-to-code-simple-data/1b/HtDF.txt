The HtDF recipe consists of the following steps:

1. Signature, purpose and stub.
2. Define examples, wrap each in check-expect.
3. Template and inventory.
4. Code the function body.
5. Test and debug until correct

;; Number -> Number
;; produces n times 2
(check-expect (double 0) (* 0 2))
(check-expect (double 1) (* 1 2))
(check-expect (double 3) (* 3 2))

;(define (double n) 0) ; this is the stub

;(define (double n)    ; this is the template
;  (... n))

(define (double n)
  (* n 2))
