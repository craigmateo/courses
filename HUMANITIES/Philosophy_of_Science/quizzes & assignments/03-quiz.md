2. **What was the moral of the story about the blind men and the elephant as it pertains to science?**

- Only collectively can scientists get closer to understanding what the world is really like. 
- Scientists combine their subjective experiences to patch together objective knowledge of the world. 

3. **What’s the difference between facts and beliefs?**

Facts are true by definition, but beliefs can be true, false or a matter of opinion. 

4. **If scientists try to remove their own personal biases, are they guaranteed  objective knowledge about what the world really like?**

No 

5. **What are some examples of epistemic values in science?**

Accuracy, simplicity and fruitfulness  

6. **Scientists are never 100% certain that their theories correspond to the facts.**

True

7. **What’s one important way scientists reach consensus about what the world is like?**

By critiquing each other’s work 

8. **Why might a study be rejected for publication during peer review?**

- If the study didn’t control for enough confounding variables 
- If the study didn’t have a sample size that’s sufficiently large to find a desired effect 
- If the study made a conclusion that the data don’t warrant 

9. **What is pre-registration?**

A publishing model that guarantees publication of a study regardless of  results if scientists register their methodology beforehand.

10. **How does pre-registration add to the objectivity of science?**

By removing the incentives that currently exist for publishing positive results. 

11. **According to Thomas Kuhn, what’s the difference between periods of normal science and periods of scientific revolution?**

- During periods of normal science, researchers do accumulate knowledge,  but during periods of scientific revolution they don’t.  
- During periods of normal science, research is guided by a paradigm, or a  certain set of methods and theories. During periods of scientific  revolution there is no paradigm to guide research.  

12. **Thomas Kuhn saw paradigm shifts in science as akin to what?**

A religious conversion experience 

13. **What balance does science get right, according to Kuhn?**

A balance between resistance and willingness to changing its foundational ideas 

14. **Helen Longino argues objectivity in science is a matter of degree. How did she suggest we should evaluate how objective science is at any given time?**

- Evaluate whether there are recognized avenues for criticism, such as  peer review and replication studies, and change in response to such  criticism.
- Evaluate whether the community has shared standards or values, such as accuracy, consistency and simplicity.
- Evaluate whether there’s equality of intellectual authority, meaning  the scientific community shouldn’t exclude the points of view of certain  people or for political reasons. 

15. **What was a flaw in the study that reported a link between the MMR vaccine and autism?**

- The study’s sample size was very small – only 12 children. 
- The study didn’t include any controls. 
- The study’s data was likely fraudulent.   

16. **What does it mean when a journal retracts a scientific paper?**

It means the journal is removing the paper from the public record.  

17. **What is a p-value?**

- A statistical measure that help scientists figure out whether there’s  difference between their experimental group and their control group.  
- A statistical measure that guides scientists in determining whether they can reject their experiment’s null hypothesis. 

18. **What is p-hacking?**

The improper, intentional or accidental, use of data analysis to find correlations between phenomena that seem significant but aren’t, namely false positives. 

19. **What did Karl Popper argue demarcates science from pseudoscience?**

Falsifiability 

20. **How does Philip Kitcher think science is different from pseudoscience?**

- The auxiliary hypotheses of scientific theories are independently testable, while those of pseudoscientific theories aren’t.  
- Scientific theories are unified by one or a few problem-solving  strategies, while pseudoscientific theories are a gerrymandered patchwork of hypotheses 
- Scientific theories are fruitful – they open up new areas of research, while pseudoscientific theories don’t.
