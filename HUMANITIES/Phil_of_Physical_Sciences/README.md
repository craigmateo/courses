### About
What is the origin of our universe? What are dark matter and dark energy?This is the first part of the course 'Philosophy and the Sciences', dedicated to Philosophy of the Physical Sciences. Scientific research across the physical sciences has raised pressing questions for philosophers. The goal of this course is to introduce you to some of the main areas and topics at the key juncture between philosophy and the physical sciences.
Each week we will introduce you to some of these important questions at the forefront of scientific research.

 We will explain the science behind each topic in a simple, non-technical way, while also addressing the philosophical and conceptual questions arising from it.  Weâ€™ll consider questions about the origin and evolution of our universe, the nature of dark energy and dark matter and the role of anthropic reasoning in the explanation of our universe.

**Learning Objectives**

- Gain a fairly well-rounded view on selected areas and topics at the intersection of philosophy and the sciences
- Understand some key questions, and conceptual problems arising in the natural sciences.
- Develop critical skills to evaluate and assess these problems.

**Suggested Reading**

To accompany 'Philosophy and the Sciences', we are pleased to announce a tie-in book from Routledge entitled 'Philosophy and the Sciences for Everyone'. This course companion to the 'Philosophy and the Sciences' course was written by the Edinburgh Philosophy and the Sciences team expressly with the needs of MOOC students in mind. 'Philosophy and the Sciences for Everyone' contains clear and user-friendly chapters, chapter summaries, glossary, study questions, suggestions for further reading and guides to online resources.

Please note, this companion book is optional - all the resources needed to complete the course are available freely and listed on the course site.
