# Week 4 Quiz: 

1. **What is the key idea Brandon Carter was trying to express in his anthropic principle?**

That the kind of observers we are will set restrictions on the kind of physical conditions we observe.

2. **What is the multiverse hypothesis?**

The hypothesis that there are other universes.

3. **Which of the following is considered to be a good feature of an explanation?**

That it makes the phenomena to be explained more likely.

4. **Why couldn’t life, such as that found on earth, exist in a two-dimensional world?**

It is almost impossible to construct a nervous system in a two-dimensional world, as in a two-dimensional plane nerves could not run through cells without crossing one another.

5. **Which of the following problems motivate the multiverse hypothesis?**

Why is the density of dark energy in the universe so small?

6. **What is the horizon problem?**

Why is every point on the sphere of last scattering at such a uniform temperature? 

7. **Why does the theory of inflation result in a multiverse?**

The process of a small domain being blown up by a large vacuum energy can happen many times in different places, resulting in many separate universes with potentially different physical properties.

8. **How does the anthropic principle explain the observed density of dark energy?**

Dark energy tends to have a very high density, but if it were any denser than observed then galaxies would not be able to form, and so we would not be around to observe it.

9.  **How can we test the theory of inflation?**

By attempting to detect ‘relic’ gravitational waves from the inflationary period.

10. **How might we come to gain empirical evidence for the existence of other universes that we could never, even in principle, observe?**

Theories that entail the existence of other universes make other predictions that are testable.  If these predictions are accurate, we gain evidence for the theory’s truth.
