# Week 3 Quiz: From intelligent machines to the human brain

1. **What is an algorithm?**

- A complicated way of encoding basic instructions. 
- [x] A set of instructions for solving a problem broken down into simple steps.
- Any mathematical function that is computable. 
- A groovy new kind of music. 

2. **What is a universal computing machine?**

- A computer that is the size of the universe. 
- [x] A machine that can carry out the same task as any other computing machine, given sufficient time and space.
- A computer that is optimised for use by anyone. 
- An electronic calculator. 

3. **What features of a system does Marr’s computational level of description pick out?**

- Any problems that occur whilst the system is running. 
- Any part of the system that might develop into an artificial intelligence. 
- [x] The problem that the system is designed to solve, i.e. its function or job.
- The set of instructions that the system uses in order to carry out its job.

4. **What features of a system does Marr’s algorithmic level of description pick out?**

- A record of the instructions that the system has carried out so far.
- The problem that the system is designed to solve, i.e. its function or job.  
- [x] The set of instructions that the system uses in order to carry out its job. 
- Any noises that occur whilst the system is running. 

5. **What features of a system does Marr’s implementation level of description pick out?**

- Any physical aspect of the system that is irrelevant to how it operates, i.e. the colour of its case. 
- The designer of the system, i.e. the one that has implemented it. 
- An input into the system that starts it off, i.e. the instructions given by a human operator. 
- [x] The actual physical structure of the system that allows it to carry out its job.

6. **What is unconscious inference?**

- [x] The unconscious process of constructing hypotheses about the distal causes of perceptual stimuli.
- The unconscious process of memory consolidation that is thought to happen whilst we dream. 
- Any mental process that goes on whilst one is unconscious. 
- The process of inferring that someone is unconscious rather than simply asleep. 

7. **In Bayes’ theorem, what do the following sets of symbols represent? (Pick the three correct answers)**

- [x] P(H) = the probability of an event (H) occurring, prior to receiving any data.
- P(D|H) = the probability (P) of an event (H) given the available data (D).
- P(H) = the probability of an event (H) occurring, after receiving any data.
- [x] P(D|H) = the probability (P) of receiving the available data (D) assuming that an event (H) has occurred.
- P(H|D) = the probability (P) of receiving the available data (D) assuming that an event (H) has occurred.
- [x] P(H|D) = the probability (P) of an event (H) given the available data (D).

8. **What is the McGurk effect, and what does it tell us about Bayesian inference?**

- [x] An illusion where what we are seeing influences what we hear, which demonstrates how combining sensory modalities can influence our hypotheses.
- An illusion where what we are seeing influences what we hear, which demonstrates how bad we are at making predictions. 
- An illusion where what we hear influences what we see, which demonstrates how combining sensory modalities can influence our hypotheses. 
- An effect where people are spontaneously able to speak a foreign language, which demonstrates how little we understand about prediction. 

9. **When will our prior beliefs most influence our actions?**

- [x] In situations of strong uncertainty, where we cannot rely heavily on perceptual data.
- When we are 100% confident that our prior beliefs are accurate. 
- When the same event is happening for the second or third time. 
- In situations of low uncertainty, where we cannot rely heavily on our prior beliefs. 

10. **In what sense can visual illusions be seen as cases of optimal perception?**

- When professional magicians perform them. 
- [x] They are the result of optimal predictions given the data available, and based on prior assumptions based on the statistics of the environment. 
- They present us with amusing experiences, and thus contribute to our wellbeing.  
- This is a trick question: visual illusions are clearly a case of non-optimal or erroneous perception.
