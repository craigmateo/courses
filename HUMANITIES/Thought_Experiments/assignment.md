
# Peer-graded Assignment: Design your own thought experiment

T​o show that you can use your imagination in the philosophical way, you have to write a Socratic dialogue in which, firstly, a philosophically relevant notion is conceptually analyzed, and subsequently, a thought experiment is described that functions as a counterexemple to that analysis.

Firstly, choose a philosophically relevant notion that has not been analyzed in the MOOC. Subsequently, write a playful dialogue in which Socrates--or whoever plays his role--pushes his interlocutors to venture an intensional definition of that notion in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. Then, design and let one of the interlocutors describe a thought experiment that functions as a counterexample to the analysis, in that it shows that one of the conditions isn’t individually necessary, or that the conditions taken together, aren’t jointly sufficient. Wrap up the dialogue with an interlocutor venturing an amended analysis or settling for a temporary conclusion.

### Review criteria

T​he most important part of the dialogue is of course the content (60%): on the one hand, the analysis that must be carefully built up, and, on the other hand, the thought experiment that must function as a counterexample to the analysis. The rubric also containts the criteria relevance (10%), playfullness (10%), structure (10%) and inquisitiveness (10%). To pass, you must obtain 55%.

observer statue 

interlocuters claim statue is not an intelligent being

**sufficient condition:**

X does not display knowledge and skill --> X is not intelligent

(If X is intelligent --> X does display knowledge and skill)

knowledge and skill are sufficient to guarantee intelligence

**necessary condition:**

knowledge and skill

X is intelligent --> X displays knowledge and skill

(X does not display knowledge and skill --> X is not intelligent)



NO: counter example (universe is intelligent)
