T​o show that you can use your imagination in the philosophical way, you have to write a Socratic dialogue in which, firstly, a philosophically relevant notion is conceptually analyzed, and subsequently, a thought experiment is described that functions as a counterexemple to that analysis.

## Dialogue
## *"Automaton (αὐτόματον)"*

*Image: Talos depicted in 5th century BCE. In Greek mythology, Talos (Τάλως, Tálōs) was a giant automaton made of bronze to protect Europa in Crete from pirates and invaders*
   
***Setting***: circa 400 B.C. in the Athens marketplace during a visiting exhibition of the wonders of Alexandria.

***Characters***: Socrates, Apollodorus (student), Hippias (sophist), Merchant

*Enter Socrates, Apollodorus, Hippias in the the marketplace*

|||
|---|---|
| *Merchant* | Behold the technological wonders from across the sea! Just as Talos in the Greek myths, this statue has come to life! |
|| *Socrates and the interloctutors look on as a statue automaton (robot) bends its arm and pours water as steam rises up* |
| *Apollodorus* | Look friends! Have the gods made this inanimate statue come to life? |
| *Hippias* | A neat trick indeed, but don't be fooled Apollodorus. It's merely a hydraulic system that moves the arm and makes this statue lifelike. Hardly the work of gods; it is a mechanical device designed by a mortal -- the Greek inventor Ctesibius. |
| *Apollodorus* | But this mechanical device is more like an intelligent being than an inanimate object. |
| *Hippias* | Just as we sophists used words and language to convince others of the truth, Ctesibius and other engineers use tools and objects to persuade onlookers that they have created life. It takes great skill to create such a mechanical device, but it is not an intelligent being. |
| *Apollodorus* | A very good point Hippias. Yes, I see now. This is not an intelligent being. Perhaps it is more accurate to say it is a mere _imitation_ of an intelligent being. |
| *Hippias* | Precisely Apollodorus. No automaton can be intelligent. |
| *Socrates* | I'm curious, what is it that makes a being intelligent? |
| *Apollodorus* | The truly intelligent being in this case is the designer, Ctesibius. It is he who has the knowledge and skill. |
| *Hippias* | Yes, clearly. An intelligent being possesses knowledge and skill. |       
| *Socrates* | So having knowledge and skill is a sufficient condition for intelligence. In other words, if a being X possesses knowledge and skill then X is intelligent. |
| *Hippias*  (with *Apollodorus* Nodding in agreement) | Yes, it seems so. Knowledge and skill are sufficient to guarantee intelligence |
| *Socrates* | Would you also claim that having knowledge and skill is a necessary condition for intelligence. So a being cannot possess intelligence unless it possesses knowledge and skill. |
| *Hippias*  (with *Apollodorus* Nodding in agreement) | Yes, knowledge and skill also are necessary for intelligence. Clearly this statue has neither knowledge nor skill. It is a mere imitation of such a being. |
| *Socrates* | But this status does pour the water, one could argue quite skillfully. No water is spilled and the pour is consistent and steady. The statue could perform this action for days and never get tired. So one could argue that when it comes to water pouring this automaton is in some respects more skilled than a mortal human. |
| *Hippias* | Perhaps it does display something like skill in this narrow domain of water pouring, but it does not know it is pouring water. In other words, unlike a mortal it has no knowledge of how to pour water, or any other action for that matter. |
| *Socrates* | So, if I understand you correctly, the statue has a certain skill but not knowledge. Likewise, we could argue that other human-made machines have skill: a ship floats, knife cuts, et cetera. But the difference between an intelligent being and these objects is that a being possesses knowledge to accompany these skills. |
| *Hippias* | If we are talking of 'skill' in that way, then yes. I think its obviously not the case that a knife, ship, or statue have knowledge. |
| *Socrates* | Does this not then imply that our definition of an intelligent being is based on knowledge alone, and not skill? In other words, knowledge is a necessary and sufficient condition for intelligence. |
| *Hippias* | It would seem so. An object can imitate skill but that does not imply it possesses knowledge. |
| *Socrates* | So if engineers designed a statue to walk like a human, it would be a mere imitation. However, since the statue does not have knowledge of how to walk it could not be intelligent. |
| *Hippias* | Yes. The knowledge of walking would still have come from the designers of the machine. |
| *Socrates* | So you would argue that the knowledge of a skill (in this case walking) is something that we humans somehow have. Were we born with this knowledge or where did this knowledge come from? |
| *Hippias* | We learn walking from other humans. By observing and trying it on our own until we have perfected the knowledge to carry out the skill, walking. |
| *Socrates* | Can we speak of walking as knowledge in this way? Consider a baby turtle who just hatches from its shell. The turtle immediately begins walking. Indeed, the little one even knows which direction the ocean is and within minutes walks to the water and swims away. Insofar as we say the turtle _knows_ how to walk or swim it seems it is something in it's nature, not something it observes or learns. |
| *Hippias* | Perhaps, with living beings it is as such. |
| *Socrates* | This knowledge is not something the turtle has as much as it is a phenomenon inherent to all turtles. So the turtle is displaying or imitating 'turtleness'. Along these lines, consider if Ctesibius and the engineers were to design a statue that displayed lifelike 'humanness' even to the extent that it could move and speak just as a mortal. Would you then concede that the statue was an intelligent being?  |
| *Hippias* | Yes, if it could speak like a mortal then it would be an intelligent being. But this is far from this statue here, which simply moves its arm with hydraulics. |
| *Socrates* | If that is the case then clearly our definition of what it means to be an intelligent being needs to be reconsidered. Even you now seem to claim that it is not *possessing* knowledge or skill but *displaying* humanlike qualities that would make a statue intelligent. But *humanlike* does not seem to be sufficient. Turtles are better at swimming than humans, so there is intelligence inherent in all lifeforms not just humans. Still too, non-living objects like knives or ships are better in some ways (i.e., cutting and floating) than living beings, so a being alive may not be a necessary condition for intelligence.  |
