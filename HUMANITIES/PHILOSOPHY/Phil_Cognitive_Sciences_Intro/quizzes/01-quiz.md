# Week 1 Quiz: Do our modern skulls house stone-age minds?

1. **What is required for a trait to be a product of natural selection? (Pick 3)**

- There must be extremely sparse resources, not just moderate competition for fairly plentiful resources.
- [x] There must be variation in the population.
- There must be extreme environmental pressure, such as we find in the arctic or at the bottom of the ocean.
- [x] It must help the organism to survive and reproduce.
- It must be beneficial to the organism's quality of life.
- [x] It must be heritable.

2. **What is interesting about the adaptations of the beaver?**

- They involve the behaviour of the organism, not just its physical shape, and this is a feature rarely seen in evolution.
- They are passed on culturally, i.e. learnt rather then inherited genetically.
- They do not contribute to the survival or reproductive success of the organism.
- [x] They have developed in response to an environment that beavers have helped to create.

3. **Which of the following are claims made by evolutionary psychology? (Pick 4)**

- All aspects of our behaviour can be explained by natural selection.
- [x] Our cognitive capacities have evolved, and are therefore adapted to our current environment. 
- We will inevitably continue to evolve and get smarter.
- [x] The human brain is adapted to challenges faced by our ancestors.
- [x] The brains we have now are the brains that our ancestors evolved to have.
- Psychologists had to evolve in order to discover evolution.
- Our adapted cognitive capacities are heritable.
- [x] The human brain is a product of natural selection.

4. **What is the Environment of Evolutionary Adaptation?**

- The environment best suited to rapid evolutionary development.
- Any environment in which evolution can take place.
- The environment that we find ourselves in today.
- [x] The historical environment that shaped the adaptations that we have today.

5. **What conclusion do Cosmides and Tooby take from the Wason selection task?**

- We have evolved to have better social skills because we’re bad at logic puzzles.
- We're good in social situations, which means that we don’t have to bother about learning logic.
- We're very good at solving abstract logic puzzles, but pretty bad at solving puzzles in social situations.
- [x] We're very good at detecting when a social norm has been violated, but pretty bad at generalising this to logically equivalent situations.

6. **Why do evolutionary psychologists favour a modular view of the brain?**

- [x] Because it is more plausible, in evolutionary terms, to imagine that the brain evolved to solve a series of distinct problems.
- Because it is more plausible, in evolutionary terms, to imagine that the brain becomes more specialised as time goes on.
- Because it is simpler for them to understand. 
- Because it turns out that the brain is constructed out of very distinct anatomical modules.

7. **What is ‘culture’, as that term is used in cognitive science?**

- Any language-based system of knowledge or behaviour that is transmitted through social leaning.
- Any system of knowledge or behaviour that has reached a certain critical level of complexity or sophistication.
- High art, including theatre, opera, art-house cinema, and literature.
- [x] Any system of knowledge or behaviour that is transmitted though social learning.

8. **What do we learn from the fact that only some chimpanzee populations use a hammer and anvil to crack nuts?**

- That genetic, not cultural, differences are responsible for the behaviour of cracking nuts with anvil.
- [x] That cultural, not genetic, differences are responsible for the behaviour of cracking nuts with an anvil.
- That neither genetic nor cultural differences are responsible for the behaviour of cracking nuts with an anvil.
- This hammers and anvils are only available in particular geographical regions.

9. **Why is human language so incredibly flexible?**

- Human language is flexible because it only evolved over the last 5000 years, which meant that it was originally developed in diverse environments. Had it evolved earlier, when humanity was less geographically diverse, it would have been less flexible.
- Human language is flexible because, unlike the communicative practices of non-human animals, it is not governed by rules, and so can be extended in novel ways.
- This is a trick question. Human languages are governed by rules, and are therefore not flexible.
- [x] Languages are rule-based, so an understanding of the rules of a language and the meaning of words is usually sufficient for understanding completely novel sentences.

10. **How can we test the cultural account of how human language evolved?**

- We can test this hypothesis by studying the very early origins of language directly, as we have recently discovered written evidence of these languages.
- Although we can’t test the origins of human language directly, we can study primitive language use in chimpanzee populations and make plausible inferences about our hominid ancestors.
- [x] We can investigate experimentally how people learn language, and develop computer simulations of these processes.
- The cultural account of how human language evolved cannot be tested. It is what Popper called a ‘metaphysical research programme’.
