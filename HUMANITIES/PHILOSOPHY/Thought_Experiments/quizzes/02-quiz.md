3. **W​hat is true according to the truth tracking analysis in the case below?**

*THE AUTHENTIC VERMEER. Han van Meegeren was a famous and infamous art forger, known, among other forgeries, for his false Vermeers. Suppose that museum Boymans Van Beuningen organizes an exhibition of van Meegeren’s false Vermeers. Furthermore, suppose that, unbeknown to the organizers, one of the paintings believed to be a forgery by van Meegeren, is in actual fact an authentic Vermeer. Finally, suppose that a gullible art lover called Marc visits the exhibition, is unaware of the fact that it’s an exhibition of forgeries of Vermeer by van Meegeren, after seeing some painting forms the belief that it’s an exhibition of Vermeers, and then finds himself in front of the authentic Vermeer. Now Marc truly and justifiably believes the painting to be a Vermeer.*

Marc doesn’t know that it’s a Vermeer, because if the painting were not a Vermeer, he would still believe it to be a Vermeer.
