## Glossary Week 3

**abduction**

inference to any explanation 

**antirealism**

view that saves the certainty of knowledge, at the expense of the existence of the mind-independent world

**Cartesian scepticism**

defining sceptical problems by means of sceptical alternatives 

**closure**

If S knows that p, and that p rules out q, then S knows that q is ruled out

**conceptual problem of scepticism**

calling into question the possibility of communication, assuming that concepts only refer to one’s own private experiences 

**contextualism**

S can know that p only if any alternative explanation q is not salient in the context

**direct realism**

realist view of, amongst others, Thomas Reid, rejecting indirect perception; illusions, hallucinations etc. are exceptions confirming the rule that most of the time, we do perceive the mind-independent, material world directly

**dispositional properties**

properties that manifest themselves under certain conditions

**empiricism**

view that all knowledge originates in sensory and/or perceptual experiences 

**epistemological problem of scepticism**

calling into question the possibility of knowledge

**experiential intermediaries**

entities that we do experience directly; Descartes’ sensations, Locke’s ideas, Hume’s impressions, Mill’s phenomena, Russell’s sense-data 

**indirect perception**

we do not perceive the world directly; perception is mediated by experiential intermediaries

**indirect realism**

view of, amongst others, John Locke, assuming indirect perception, and arguing for realism by means of inference to the best explanation 

**inference to the best explanation**

subclass of abduction, adopting a criterion like, e.g., simplicity, to identify the best among all possible explanations 

**metaphysical problem of scepticism**

calling into question the mind-independent existence of the world

**other minds, problem of**

calling into question the mind-independent existence of the world

**phenomenalism**

calling into question the mind-independent existence of the world

**realism**

view that saves the existence of the mind-independent world, at the expense of the certainty of knowledge

**relevant alternatives approach**

view that saves the existence of the mind-independent world, at the expense of the certainty of knowledge

**response-dependence**

the third way, midway between realism and anti-realism; analysing the relation between mind-independent reality and sensory experiences by means of dispositional properties

**sceptical alternatives**

conceivable and thereby logically possible alternative explanations that cannot be ruled out

**secondary qualities**

dispositional properties that only manifest themselves under certain conditions in the response of certain epistemic or, more broadly, cognitive subjects, traditionally including colour, taste, smell and sound

**solipsism**

view that one’s own mind is all that exists 

**transcendental idealism**

view of, amongst others, Kant, that there is an external, mind-independent reality, but that it is completely unknowable

**veil of perception**

ramification of indirect perception that our experiences may be completely detached from the external world, since we only perceive experiential intermediaries directly
