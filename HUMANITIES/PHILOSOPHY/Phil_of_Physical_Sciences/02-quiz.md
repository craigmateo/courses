# Week 2 Quiz: The origins of the universe

1. **What is the scope of cosmology?**

The study of the universe as a whole.

2. **How did Newton’s _Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy_ lay the foundations for modern physics?**

It provided testable laws of nature that could explain a variety of observable phenomena.

3. **What is the Kant-Laplace nebular hypothesis?**

One of the first attempts at a scientific explanation of the origins of the universe based on the hypothesis of an initial nebula of gases from which planets and stars formed.

4. **What were the three problems that faced cosmology in particular as a branch of science?** 

- **Laws of Nature**: The issue of how we can know that the same laws of nature we observe today were operative at the beginning of the universe.
- **Uniqueness**: Scientific practice typically involves repeating tests using multiple different samples of the object of study in different circumstances.  This is impossible when the object of study is the universe as a whole.
- **Unobservability**: Since the expansion of the universe is accelerating there are parts of the universe from which information will never be able to reach us. As a result, there are parts of the universe we will never be able to observe.

5. **How do we know that galaxies are receding from us?**

Because of the way that light shifts further towards the red end of the spectrum the further it has travelled.

6. **What do we learn from the observed accelerating rate of expansion of the universe?**

That space is filled with dark energy.

7. **How does the physicist Smolin tackle the issue of whether our current laws of nature apply to the early universe?**

**Cosmological Natural Selection**: Laws evolve with our universe and they are not timeless.

8. **How might Karl Popper’s _falsificationism_ provide a solution to the problem of uniqueness in cosmology?**

Theories within cosmology make “risky” novel predictions which can be tested empirically, and potentially falsified.  For example, the discovery of Cosmic Microwave Background falsified Bondi’s Steady-State theory.  This empirical falsifiability is what is distinctive of science, according to Popper.

9. **What is the origin of the ‘cosmic microwave background’?**

When the universe cools and forms atoms, radiation can travel freely, becoming redshifted to the microwave region by the time we receive it.

10. **What is meant by ‘telescopes are time machines’?**

We see distant parts of the universe through telescopes as they were in the deep past, because light takes time to reach us.
