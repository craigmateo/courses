# Week 3 Quiz: Dark matter and dark energy

1. **What is the conclusion of the underdetermination argument?**

That one cannot be justified in believing some theory T1 if there is another theory T2 which has the same empirical consequences.

2. **What did the discovery of the anomalous perihelion of the planet Uranus reveal?**

That _either_ some of the main theoretical hypotheses concerning the laws of Newtonian mechanics or some of the auxiliary hypotheses concerning the number of planets in the Solar system were false and required revision.

3. **Amongst others, which of the following criteria govern theory choice, according to Kuhn?**

- Consistency (the theory is consistent with other accepted scientific theories)
- Accuracy (the theory is in agreement with experimental evidence)
- Fruitfulness (the theory should be able to predict novel phenomena)

4. **Friedmann’s equation is $(dR/dt)^2 – 8πGρR2/3 = –K$.  But what, in essence, does it tell us?**

It tells us that kinetic plus potential energy is a constant.

5. **Why are Ia supernovae useful to cosmologists?**

Since Ia supernovae all have very similar energy outputs, and the energy observed from an object lessens with distance, they can be used to measure distances across space.

6. **Why is the universe less dense now than in the past?**

Because the universe has expanded over time.

7. **Which of the following provides evidence for the existence of dark matter?** 

It explains certain observable gravitational effects, such as the speed with which the outskirts of galaxies rotate.

8. **Why do many cosmologists find the LTB model unattractive as an alternative to dark energy?**

It violates the Copernican principle, i.e. the assumption that we don’t occupy any special or privileged position in the universe.

9. **What is _Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND)_?**

A rival theory to dark matter which explains galaxies’ flat rotation curves by assuming that Newton’s second law needs be modified below a certain threshold.

10. **What kind of indirect empirical support might there be for the concordance model?**

The success of classical Newtonian dynamics and general relativity in other areas of science (i.e. the current cosmological model is embedded in a larger theoretical framework via which empirical support accrues).
