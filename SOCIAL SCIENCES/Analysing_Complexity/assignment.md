# Final assignment for Course 1: Analysing Complexity

Your principal task for Course 1 is to define a problem that can serve as the subject of a Briefing Paper. 

Using the exploratory writing you have completed for each Module, define a properly-scaled problem, including a clear statement of this problem’s significance in relation to your chosen organisation’s mission statement (or equivalent).

**Problem Summary**: Price signals in the silver market.

How can _The Silver Institute_ facilitate intelligent price signals in the global silver market? 

The week 5 module "Complexity, Fragility, and Breakdown" outlines how economies are complex systems. Economic models are, therefore, often inadequate to explain and predict economic crises. The modern economy runs on raw materials, which means this economic complexity is embedded in already complex systems: geological, ecological, etc.

Markets are a way for diverse human agents to coordinate within economic systems. Prices are the dynamic signaling mechanisms of markets. Prices send signals to producers and consumers that lead to behaviors (e.g., buy, sell, produce, invest). In theory, economic systems are based on the assumption that there is intelligence inherent in price signals. 

However, prices are themselves complex and constantly fluctuating. Price signals can be problematic (or 'unintelligent') for a variety of reasons such as information asymmetry, privileged actors (e.g., monopolies), uncertainties, risks, etc.

To illustrate the point, we can consider the metal silver. Silver is vital for many complex technologies. As the best conductor, it will no doubt be essential to future technologies, especially related to clean energy and electrification. Silver has also played an important role as a monetary metal throughout history and in many societies and civilizations. The sustainable, long term supply of silver is crucial to the functioning of an advanced economy. The supply will, in turn, depend on intelligent pricing mechanisms.

As a non-profit body and industry association the _The Silver Institute_ has the mandate to foster knowledge and information about silver. Information related to silver pricing is core to this mandate and to the organization's mission as a whole. One could even argue that the pricing of silver is essential to the global economic system.
