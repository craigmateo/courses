# Effecting Cultural Continuity &amp; Change

1. Culture is static and unchanging, that is, constant over time.



2. Habitual inertia resists change.



3. Metaculture is culture that reflects upon other culture.



4. We CANNOT look at nations and empires as teams. 



5. Metaculture can be used to effect cultural change.



6. Good team leaders need to be aware of the similarities between old and new culture.



7. To have a successful culture change, the new culture must build on existing culture.



8. Culture CANNOT influence what people are interested in. 



9.  Sometimes people are NOT interested in a particular cultural activity, but rather in the CONSEQUENCES of performing that activity. 



10. An example of the Elastic Effect is when we are deprived of the food we are used to eating, we find ourselves wanting that food.
