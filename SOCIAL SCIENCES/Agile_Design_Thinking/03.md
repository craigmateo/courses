1. Why are red button directives problematic for teams?

- [ ] Teams get bogged down making user interface design features.  
- [ ] Teams with too much creative freedom lose focus and are less motivated.  
- [ ] Too many unfamiliar design features can confuse and annoy users.
- [x] They lack explanation about what's valuable to the user and how to test for that

Red button problems are often arbitrary tasks that may not address the user's needs and lead to a valuable outcome for the end user. Teams are often also less motivated when given a specification rather than exploring solutions.

2. You're working with a catering firm to improve its website. Which of these user stories about their user is most complete?

- [ ] As a mother planning a quinceanera party, I want to check the site, so I can make a decision about catering. 
- [ ] As a person checking the catering website, I want to see if I like the vibe of this firm.  
- [ ] As a visitor to the catering website, I want to see sample event photos so that I can see if I'd like this caterer.  
- [x] As a bride planning a wedding, I want to see a list of venues where the firm is allowed to cater so that I can confirm whether the caterer can service my wedding location.  

This user story is the most complete because it identifies a persona, what the user wants to do, and how the user will derive a benefit.

3. A project manager writes a set of user stories in your issue tracking system, JIRA, and assigns them to developers to begin work. Which element of Bill Wake's INVEST checklist is more immediately applicable to improving this situation?

- [x] Negotiable
- [ ] Small
- [ ] Estimable
- [ ] Independent

One of the most important underlying points of 'Negotiable' is that user stories are not a specification; they are an aid for collaboration. User stories that drive better outcomes are almost always co-created by the team through collaboration and story writing workshops.  

4. When coaching your team to create strong user stories, which of the following is most effective?

- [ ] Ask the team to estimate the length of time it will take to finish the project 
- [x] Ask the team how they would test the reward/outcome clause in the story.
- [ ] Time is of the essence -- get straight to the point and note all errors  
- [ ] Encourage teams to build a working prototype. 

Testing is a powerful way to reveal whether or not the narrative is strong and relevant. Teams should be encouraged to ask themselves this question throughout the process.

5. What would you add to the following meeting agenda to make the most of the collaborative experience?  Meeting Agenda -Review existing personas and problem scenarios (prep by reading user stories)-Day in the Life game-Storyboard first epic (George &amp; Leslie co-facilitate) 

- [x] Time box the sessions  
- [ ] Add an agenda item that will help the team understand if what they are building is valuable   
- [ ] Include an activity to build empathy with the end user  
- [ ] Add something that will energize and encourage creative solutions from the team   

Work tends to expand into the time you have available for it. Without time boxing, teams may overdo the level of detail needed and agonize over details they should probably save (and test) later. Also, time-boxing often has the somewhat counterintuitive benefit of making participants more spontaneous.
