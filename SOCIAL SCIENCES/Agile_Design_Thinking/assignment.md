# Peer Assignment

### Personas, Problem Scenarios and Propositions, and User Stories

## Part 1: Positioning Statement

For SHARE Agriculture Foundation who needs to communicate project results to donors, the interactive map is a web-based application that geographically
displays the location of projects along with interactive data and photos. Unlike World Vision, our product is a web-based geovisualization as opposed to
static document for donor outreach.

## Part 2: Brainstorm Personas

|1: Free Form Personas List- More is More Here!|2: List in Priority Order |3: Notes (Optional)|
|---|---|---|
|Bob the Big Donor, Lorna the Little Donor, Vic the Volunteer, Barb the Board Member, Peter the Project Manager, Saul the Southern Partner, Evan the Event Attendee, Will the Website Visitor, Freddie the Foundation Officer|Bob the Big Donor, Peter the Project Manager, Freddie the Foundation Officer, Lorna the Little Donor, Vic the Volunteer, Barb the Board Member, Saul the Southern Partner, Evan the Event Attendee, Will the Website Visitor | Since the organization has a need to attract new funds and diversify its donor base, attracting more Bobs to the cause is the current priority |
 

## Part 3: Make Your Persona Testable & Actionable with a Screener
|Persona|Screening Question|Threshold|
|---|---|---|
|Bob the Big Donor|How much did you give to charitable causes last year? | >$25000|  

## Part 4: Develop Problem Scenario, Alternatives, Proposition Trios

|Problem Scenarios/Jobs-to-be-Done|Current Alternatives|Your Value Proposition|
|---|---|---|
|Lots of organizations/causes in need of funds and it’s difficult to distinguish between them.|Donate to large international organizations with staff and marketing.|A smaller organization who works in remote areas that larger orgs. do not reach.|
|There are many local programs (as opposed to international programs like SHARE’s) and it is often easier to see the impact closer to home.|Most current donations go to local causes. Bob donates to higher education and health care research.|International programs with a chance to have a direct impact on a large number of people. Relating to distance communities in new ways.|

## Part 5: Design a Solution for Your PS/JTBD with User Stories

### Epic User Stories

1. As a Donor, I want to look at a map to see where my donations have had an impact.
2. As a Project Manager, I want to click on a map location and show what type of program was delivered at that location.
3. As a Project Manager, I want to click on a project location and show photos/videos of people involved in the project there.

### Child Stories for Epic 1

|Child Stories|General Notes & Analytics|
|---|---|
|As a PM I use the interactive map in presentations and meetings.|Needs to display well on large screens. Maybe have animation mode separate from interactive mode.| 
|As a Donor I can share the web interactive with others who might be interested.|Email and social media links. Number of shares available on site analytics.|
|As a Donor I don’t know how many people benefitted in each location so I can click on the map and get the number of beneficiaries.|Data visualizations in d3js.|
