1. How do actionable personas and problem scenarios help development teams avoid waste?

- [x] They keep the team focused on solving problems that truly matter to the user  
- [ ] They help humanize things  
- [ ] They focus the team's energy on evolving problems and complex solutions
- [ ] They help the team focus on solutions right from the start  

By developing a deep understanding and empathy for the user, the team can develop creative solutions to user problems that truly matter.

2. Which descriptor below contains elements of an effective persona?

- [ ] Senior citizens ages 70-85  
- [x] Sally the Senior Citizen  
- [ ] 60% said they would use an app to remind them when they need to take medications
- [ ] Looking forward to enjoying their golden years

Naming a persona is a first-step toward developing a specific and fully developed sense of who this persona is and what makes them tick.

3. Imagine you're exploring medical business practices for self-employed doctors and are developing the following persona: Dave the Doctor has been a general surgeon for 15 years. He opened his own practice right after he finished his residency. It was difficult at first to get referrals, but his practice is thriving now.Which of the following does the LEAST to enhance the persona?

- [ ] Spent $82,000 last year to manage the administrative part of his practice
- [ ] Keeps in touch with his friends from medical school through email, Facebook, and a couple of annual conferences they try to attend together.
- [x] 40 - 55 years old  
- [ ] Reads the news on his phone every morning while he eats breakfast

This is too general and doesn't help bring Dave to life. Stating his exact age might help make Dave seem more real. Watch the "Demo: Drafting Personas" video to review.

4. It's often useful to go 'up' one level and 'down' one level to think about whether your target problem is at the right level of abstraction. If you did this, which of these would not be part of your work?

- [ ] A defined, testable user problem  
- [ ] A higher-level problem that's the 'parent' of your current problem secnario
- [ ] One or more 'child' problem scenarios that break down the problem scenario into more detailed jobs or habits you believe exist for the user
- [x] The value proposition   

Problem scenarios are a good place to start, but the value proposition is not part of the problem scenario. It's an idea about how you might deliver on a problem scenario. 

5. Applying the Thinks, Sees, Feels, Does framework helps reveal all of the following except....

- [ ] Interactions that shape the persona's thinking
- [x] The solution this persona will prefer
- [ ] Tension between what is and the persona's ideal
- [ ] What emotions the persona's experiences around the area of interest

Personas (and problem scenarios) are important for establishing a foundation in who your user is and what makes them tick. It does not directly predict what they're going to buy or use. Answering that question requires a different set up of techniques--creating a value hypothesis and running tests on motivation (all this closely related to the practice of 'Lean Startup').
