1.   You've released a new feature and (holy smokes!) it turns out that the problem it's supposed to solve for the user clearly does not exist. The feature is irrelevant; the users don't care. The team wants to just go ahead and finish up enhancements to the feature since a lot of the hard work is done, but you're confident that's going to be wasteful. What part of the Agile Manifesto is most applicable to the decision the team now has to make?  

- [ ] Working software &gt; comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Individual interactions &gt; processes and tools
- [x] Responding to change &gt; following a plan
- [ ] Customer collaboration &gt; contract negotiation

Plans give us the certainty we crave and as soon as you start working on a feature, you get attached to it. It's natural, but it's not the best way to innovate. This part of the Manifesto reminds us that we need to be ready to observe change and act on evidence even when it means changing direction.    

1. One of your company's salespeople is having her own 'blue button' moment: She notices that clients have to click several times to access their account information, and are consistently annoyed. As a part of the product team, what can you do to help influence her in the right direction?

- [ ] Let sales management know that feedback is important and that they might want to consider adding it to the job description and annual reviews. 
- [ ] Make sure a representative from product comes to all the quarterly sales meetings to present and hear feedback from interested salespeople.  
- [ ] Write an email to all the salespeople clearly explaining that the best way to increase sales is to improve the product and that you need their feedback for that. 
- [x] Create a template for recording actionable observations, test whether it's workable for the salespeople, and hold regular interactive sessions where the product team talks about what they've learned and how they're acting on it.

Successful agile teams are self-organizing and interdisciplinary. That requires thoughtful interfaces not only between individuals on a team but also with the customers/users and other company stakeholders. To cultivate the intrinsic motivation that this requires, all the participants have to know that what they're doing matters. 

3. Why is narrative collaboration around user stories critical to agile development?

- [ ] It maximizes the strengths of individual team members
- [x] It gets all members of the team involved in discussing what to develop and why
- [ ] It ensures all team members are involved.
- [ ] The user stories are creative

Narrative collaboration helps teams drive towards valuable, customer-relevant implementations.

4. As a specialist who values interactions over processes and tools, what can you do to contribute to an agile environment?

- [ ] Assign carefully specified tasks to team members.  
- [ ] Create a detailed plan before iterating.
- [ ] Review specifications to ensure you're on track.
- [x] Ask questions like "Why does the user want to do this? and "How will we know if this works?"

  As a specialist, asking these types of questions helps to keep the team focused on narrative (user stories and personas) that drives agile development.  

5. Which of the following practices, if introduced into a company's workflows, would be most beneficial in helping create a culture of disciplined experimentation and testing?

- [ ] Using kanban, XP, or scrum
- [x] Applying the scientific method to product development
- [ ] Making brainstorming part of the process
- [ ] Being respectful of people's different ideas

The scientific method for innovation means defining and testing a compelling idea.
